# 77 Common Mistakes

It is hard to play a perfect game of Diplomacy. 

I sure am yet to and doubt I ever will give a flawless performance.

There are just too many mistakes, not to mention pitfalls, into which one can unknowingly walk. 

## No. 77 Not Speaking To All Players

No matter which Power you control, you will be at a disadvantage if you don't speak to all players. 

The more information you can gather, the better. 

As the game carries on, the relationships you have with each player matters, often critically.

In Top Board situations, if a player was on good terms with you and can't win themselves, they may opt to tilt the game slightly in your favor and against your competitor/s for the board top.

## No. 76 Not Speaking Equally to All Players

It takes a good dose of time management skill to spend enough time with each player every year, every season. 

How are you planning to enter and exit conversations so as to meet your own goals of corresponding with every player? 

Even when you are certain of your moves this season and those moves are tactical guarantees, you would do well not to waste the opportunity to gain information about other players' plans and to influence their decisions in favor of your own medium term goals. 

## No. 75 Speaking to Players in the Same Order

Have you spoken with the same player or players in the same order each round? 

This approach may be intentional and necessary at certain points in a game, however bear in mind its perception on other players who desire your audience.

When someone wants to talk to you--and you know they are not merely trying to distract you or waste your time--you might do well to have a discussion and see what comes of it. 

I personally have a lot to learn in this regard. I want to develop a way of negotiating with each and every player that remains courteous toward each player and also effective in achieving my goals of information gathering and strategic decision making.

## No. 74 Deciding What Your Orders Are Prior to Negotiating

It is not uncommon to write a preliminary move set based on your brief analysis of the position. This approach can actually be quite strong as it allows you to negotiate toward a set of orders that you've decided in advance is decent.

The downside, however, is that you may be less flexible in adapting to new information and less able to shift your position having set your initial anchor.

## No. 73 Not Changing Your Orders Based on New Information

Practicing Bayesian probabilities should allow you to adjust your orders to make the best play for you tactically and strategically. The only question left is, Should you alert anyone to your changes? 

Is there time left on the clock to do so? 

## No. 72 Not Paying Attention to Time Spent Negotiating

Keep an eye on the clock!

Obviously, you must get your orders in on time. 

More importantly, however, taking account of who is spending the most time together, and noticing shifts in time spent, might alert you to shifts in alliance structures or near-term stabs. 

## No. 71 Oversimplifying a Player Read

You've decided Player A is an aggressive diplomat, strategically sound, yet tactically weak, while Player B is confident, strategically weak, and a moderate tactician. 

These may be useful heuristics to open the game. But once you are in the thick of the action, you must adjust your settings to which version of a player you are playing with TODAY. 

(And notice as that person changes with stabs or reversals of fortune.)

## No. 70 Ignoring Underlying Motivations

What is motivating my opponent right now? 

Has that changed from game start? 

Can I pinpoint his emotional state in such a way as to create a connection that might be useful for our relationship. Sometimes people just like to be heard and understood. 

## No. 69 Not Making Your Own Intentions Clear

With the Austrian pieces in a recent game, I moved to Bohemia from Vienna. My intention was to keep my Russian ally onside till I could arrange a stab, with Boh-Gal and Ser-Rum (and Bul S Ser-Rum), but I forgot one simple thing: to share my intentions with Germany. 

You see, I also had an army in Tyrolia (I was lining up against Italy as well), so Germany assumed that with A Tyr and A Boh I was gunning for Munich. 

It took precious time to make him understand, negotiation time I might have been using elsewhere that season.

## No. 68 Disregarding the Scoring System

Outside the heat of battle, Diplomacy players are passionate about what the best scoring systems are. In-game, the only mistake as a player is to disregard whatever the scoring system happens to be.

If you are playing a sum of squares club game under time pressure as a nearly eliminated power, it's better to work with one of the stronger powers to eliminate others than to work with those other fledgling powers to play balance of power. (This is one area where I believe I prefer Janus as it changes the behavior of powers near elimination toward mutual survival.) The logic is that if you are going to go down, then you want at least one or two other powers going down with you, else your relative score in the game will be weak. A club game system rewards results over time. 

If you are playing a multi-round tournament, play the way that lets you have the best chance of winning the tournament or reaching the Top Board. 

If you are playing a Top Board that disregards score for the tournament standings, then there can be only one winner. Adjust your strategy accordingly. Kingmaker and other considerations come into play. 

If you are playing a stand alone online game on Backstabbr or a stand alone face to face, the scoring system is more ambiguous. What should you value? Solos, board-top, big draws, survival? That is up for debate. 

## No. 67 Making Alliances Too Obvious

Even one season of deception should give your early game alliance the tempo it needs to strike at a neighbor. 

In Minnesota's Top Board for 2019, at least one player finished the game thinking Italy had stabbed my Austria, when in fact we had arranged the 'Modern Borders' Italian ownership of Trieste in 1901. 

## No. 66 Not Finding a Neighbor with whom to Collaborate

It is very difficult to make progress in Diplomacy after 1902 without some level of collaboration. Sure, it is possible to spark chaos around the map and profit incrementally, but perhaps only Germany, Austria, and Russia have the ability for fast enough growth to take advantage of these chaotic situations sans ally. 

Italy is an interesting case as you might like to imbalance the game such that other players actions benefit you. Or, indeed, that thy come to you at the moments of imbalance recognizing your strategic leverage.

In other situations, life without a partner or at least someone who doesn't want to see you eliminated quickly, is short.

## No. 65 Giving Up on a Bad Position

One mark of your worth as a Diplomacy player is how you emotionally handle setbacks. Don't give up! How you play suboptimal positions affects every other player on the board. You can't change what happened, but you might be able to change how it goes from here.

Remember, in the long run, your perceived ranking and indeed your overall rating as a Diplomacy player will not be judged by how well you played a 12-center Russia, but by how well you played the 2-center France. 

If I may offer a poker analogy: In the long run every player receives the same cards, the same flops, turns, and rivers, against the same variation of hands his opponent received against him; can you play your cards--especially the marginal and bad ones--better than your opponents? 

## No. 64 Clinging to Ally

The status quo bias sometimes makes a player cling to previous decisions, including their choice of ally. 

The state of the board, the relationships, these can change, and so then should who and how you work with others.

## No. 63 Refusing to Make Good with an Ally Post Stab

You will stab and you will be stabbed. 

Use the next negotiation to address what happened, figure out where you stand, and decide on a new plan. Maybe at this point you are incentivized to lie to your former ally. In that case, so be it. But at least you explored your options. 

Obviously, stabs are part of the game. It doesn't mean they don't hurt. Acknowledging that you got one over on another player, explaining why you did it, and answering any questions they have, these approaches might make their behavior toward you better (in the game) and future conversations more pleasant. 

## No. 62 Failing to Commit

Since cooperation through supports and support-cutting is critical tactically, sometimes you have to commit to a move even without tactical guarantees. You can weigh your strategic and tactical options forever, but the clock doesn't care that your orders weren't in the box on time. Your possible allies will.

## No. 1 Stealing Another Player's Destiny

We would all do well to return again to inspect the models we've built of the game, including our strategic biases with each power, or how we present ourselves as a negotiator. 

Even in teachable moments, it is a fine line between mentoring and stealing another person's destiny.
