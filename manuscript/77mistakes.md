# 77 Common Mistakes

You miss 100% of the mistakes you don't try to commit. Even if you try to avoid mistakes, you'll make them anyway. It's the way of the world.  

Jokes aside, it is extremely hard to play even a near-perfect game of Diplomacy. 

I am damn sure yet to and highly doubt I ever will give a near-flawless performance.

There are just too many mistakes, not to mention pitfalls, into which one can unknowingly walk.  

Here's just a few of them. Maybe you can think of more.  

## No. 77 Not Speaking To All Players

No matter which Power you control, you will be at a disadvantage if you don't speak to all players. 

The more information you can gather, the better. 

As the game carries on, the relationships you have with each player matters, often critically.

In Top Board situations, if a player was on good terms with you and can't win themselves, they may opt to tilt the game slightly in your favor and against your competitor/s for the board top.

## No. 76 Not Speaking Equally to All Players

It takes a good dose of time management skill to spend enough time with each player every year, every season. 

How are you planning to enter and exit conversations so as to meet your own goals of corresponding with every player? 

Even when you are certain of your moves this season and those moves are tactical guarantees, you would do well not to waste the opportunity to gain information about other players' plans and to influence their decisions in favor of your own medium term goals. 

Diplomacy has definitely helped me deal with difficult conversations. Having a policy of emebracing equal time with each player will force you to have those difficult but potentially profitable conversations in fortuitous moments. 

## No. 75 Speaking to Players in the Same Order

Have you spoken with the same player or players in the same order each round? 

This approach may be intentional and necessary at certain points in a game, however bear in mind its perception on other players who desire your audience.

When someone wants to talk to you--and you know they are not merely trying to distract you or waste your time--you might do well to have a discussion and see what comes of it. 

I personally have a lot to learn in this regard. I want to develop a way of negotiating with each and every player that remains courteous toward each player and also effective in achieving my goals of information gathering and strategic decision making.

## No. 74 Deciding What Your Orders Are Prior to Negotiating

It is not uncommon to write a preliminary move set based on your brief analysis of the position. This approach can actually be quite strong as it allows you to negotiate toward a set of orders that you've decided in advance is decent.

The downside, however, is that you may be less flexible in adapting to new information and less able to shift your position having set your initial anchor.

## No. 73 Not Changing Your Orders Based on New Information

Practicing Bayesian probabilities should allow you to adjust your orders to make the best play for you tactically and strategically. The only question left is, Should you alert anyone to your changes? 

Is there time left on the clock to do so? 

## No. 72 Not Paying Attention to Time Spent Negotiating

Keep an eye on the clock!

Obviously, you must get your orders in on time. 

More importantly, however, taking account of who is spending the most time together, and noticing shifts in time spent, might alert you to shifts in alliance structures or near-term stabs. 

## No. 71 Oversimplifying a Player Read

You've decided Player A is an aggressive diplomat, strategically sound, yet tactically weak, while Player B is confident, strategically weak, and a moderate tactician. 

These may be useful heuristics to open the game. But once you are in the thick of the action, you must adjust your settings to which version of a player you are playing with TODAY. 

(And notice as that person changes with stabs or reversals of fortune.)

## No. 70 Ignoring Underlying Motivations

What is motivating my opponent right now? 

Has that changed from game start? 

Can I pinpoint his emotional state in such a way as to create a connection that might be useful for our relationship. Sometimes people just like to be heard and understood. 

## No. 69 Not Making Your Own Intentions Clear

With the Austrian pieces in a recent game, I moved to Bohemia from Vienna. My intention was to keep my Russian ally onside till I could arrange a stab, with Boh-Gal and Ser-Rum (and Bul S Ser-Rum), but I forgot one simple thing: to share my intentions with Germany. 

You see, I also had an army in Tyrolia (I was lining up against Italy as well), so Germany assumed that with A Tyr and A Boh I was gunning for Munich. 

It took precious time to make him understand, negotiation time I might have been using elsewhere that season.

## No. 68 Disregarding the Scoring System

Outside the heat of battle, Diplomacy players are passionate about what the best scoring systems are. In-game, the only mistake as a player is to disregard whatever the scoring system happens to be.

If you are playing a sum of squares club game under time pressure as a nearly eliminated power, it's better to work with one of the stronger powers to eliminate others than to work with those other fledgling powers to play balance of power. (This is one area where I believe I prefer Janus as it changes the behavior of powers near elimination toward mutual survival.) The logic is that if you are going to go down, then you want at least one or two other powers going down with you, else your relative score in the game will be weak. A club game system rewards results over time. 

If you are playing a multi-round tournament, play the way that lets you have the best chance of winning the tournament or reaching the Top Board. 

If you are playing a Top Board that disregards score for the tournament standings, then there can be only one winner. Adjust your strategy accordingly. Kingmaker and other considerations come into play. 

If you are playing a stand alone online game on Backstabbr or a stand alone face to face, the scoring system is more ambiguous. What should you value? Solos, board-top, big draws, survival? That is up for debate. 

## No. 67 Making Alliances Too Obvious

Even one season of deception should give your early game alliance the tempo it needs to strike at a neighbor. 

In Minnesota's Top Board for 2019, at least one player finished the game thinking Italy had stabbed my Austria, when in fact we had arranged the 'Modern Borders' Italian ownership of Trieste in 1901. 

## No. 66 Not Finding a Neighbor with whom to Collaborate

It is very difficult to make progress in Diplomacy after 1902 without some level of collaboration. Sure, it is possible to spark chaos around the map and profit incrementally, but perhaps only Germany, Austria, and Russia have the ability for fast enough growth to take advantage of these chaotic situations sans ally. 

Italy is an interesting case as you might like to imbalance the game such that other players actions benefit you. Or, indeed, that thy come to you at the moments of imbalance recognizing your strategic leverage.

In other situations, life without a partner or at least someone who doesn't want to see you eliminated quickly, is short.

## No. 65 Giving Up on a Bad Position

One mark of your worth as a Diplomacy player is how you emotionally handle setbacks. Don't give up! How you play suboptimal positions affects every other player on the board. You can't change what happened, but you might be able to change how it goes from here.

Remember, in the long run, your perceived ranking and indeed your overall rating as a Diplomacy player will not be judged by how well you played a 12-center Russia, but by how well you played the 2-center France. 

If I may offer a poker analogy: In the long run every player receives the same cards, the same flops, turns, and rivers, against the same variation of hands his opponent received against him; can you play your cards--especially the marginal and bad ones--better than your opponents? 

## No. 64 Clinging to Ally

The status quo bias sometimes makes a player cling to previous decisions, including their choice of ally. 

The state of the board, the relationships, these can change, and so then should who and how you work with others.

## No. 63 Refusing to Make Good with an Ally Post Stab

You will stab and you will be stabbed. 

Use the next negotiation to address what happened, figure out where you stand, and decide on a new plan. Maybe at this point you are incentivized to lie to your former ally. In that case, so be it. But at least you explored your options. 

Obviously, stabs are part of the game. It doesn't mean they don't hurt. Acknowledging that you got one over on another player, explaining why you did it, and answering any questions they have, these approaches might make their behavior toward you better (in the game) and future conversations more pleasant. 

## No. 62 Failing to Commit

Since cooperation through supports and support-cutting is critical tactically, sometimes you have to commit to a move even without tactical guarantees. You can weigh your strategic and tactical options forever, but the clock doesn't care that your orders weren't in the box on time. Your possible allies will. 

## No. 61 Not Listening

You must Listen.

To your gut. To your opponents. To the whispers that slip into your eavesdropping toolkit. 

If you're at all like me, you love to talk. You love to share what you think. 

But sometimes, you can't gain as much information by talking as by listening. (Of course, even when talking, you should be listening to your opponent's nonverbals.)

For details on how to listen, try Carl Rogers.

## No. 60 Inviting a Brutal Stab

Leaving yourself too wide open for a stab will unnecessarily invite it. 

For example: Better to leave an army on the island as England as a deterrant if you are weary of France coming in the side door. 

## No. 59 Not Using a Received Stab to Your Advantage

With the successful stab against you, the board situation has changed. As the receiver of that stab, you have some proportional influence on how players react. You get to tell your story about what happened, about your former ally's plans. You get to tell a new story about your plans. 

To be stabbed is on balance not such a bad thing. In some moments, it is the best thing to happen to you. (Try inviting a harmless stab so as to galvanize neighbors in your favor.)

## No. 58 Not Looking Inside Yourself

What do you really want? Out of this tournament? From this game? From this conversation? 

Go in with both an open mind and with a plan. 

Start by asking yourself what you want. 

## No. 57 Missing the Chance to Tell a Story

Stories are persuasive. Selectively use them to make an emotionally persuasive case during your negotiations.

## No. 56 Pretending Not to Suffer

Diplomacy makes you suffer! (That's part of why we like it.)

For me, certain kinds of suffering are good for us. Embracing, instead of ignoring, this suffering will make you miss chances to learn.

## No. 55 Running from the Truth

The board position, the relationships, the fact that you have three centers when you once had eight.  

Play the board as it lies. 

Play the position as it is.

Don't run from the truth.

## No. 54 Ignoring Asks

Players will ask you for things. You should ask them for things, too. 

Ignoring asks is a mistake in Diplomacy, because by working together with other players, you not only get the benefits of supports or support-cutting, but you also know that player's units are working in concert with you and not against you.

If you ignore asks, your opponents will ask your other neighbors.

## No. 53 Surprising People

Being unpredictable has tradeoffs, but the ability to be unpredictable is an asset. 

Show them something they haven't seen before. Even with a reputation as a solid, conservative player, the ability to pull off a move will give them something to talk about. 

## No. 52 The Ability to Make Someone Believe You

When you can say something in such a way as to make someone believe you, then in key moments you'll be able to secure a much-needed support from another player.

## No. 51 Losing Your Self-Discipline

Remember your preparation. Remember what you came here to do. 

I'm not saying not to show your emotions. Our emotions interplay with our thinking. As humans we think with our bodies too. But losing oneself when trying to influence another is risky because, without a measure of self-discipline, greater variance in outcome results because it's harder to know what you will say, how you will say it, and how much you mean what you say. 

## No. 50 Losing Track of the Board Position

Every turn the board changes. As in baseball, the count changes ever so slightly. It's 2-2, then 3-2, full count, and even if the batter fouls off the next pitch, the pitcher has thrown one more pitch, is getting fatigued, and the tension remains nonetheless. 

Look for tension in your opponents demeanor and in the board position.

## No. 49 Not Saying Thank You

When a player speaks with you, you might thank him. He doesn't have to speak with you. 

If a player does you a favor or shares a piece of information, acknowledge it. That's a small reward that will possibly encourage future behavior just like that. 

## No. 48 Opening to the English Channel

If you are going to get bounced.

Under few circumstances should your orders put you at serious risk of ruin. If you learn through the grapevine that England is planning to order F Lon - ENG (with 100% probability), then I see little alternative (if negotiation is over) to ordering F Bre - ENG.  

A possible exception to this thinking is while playing as Austria. Of course, versions of the Hedgehog ensure survival till at least 1902, not all continuations give Austria the appropriate leverage or position to combine with neighbors in mutually profitable ways. To provide an example, it may be necessary to risk an Italian stab in order to position units to work with or against either of Russia or Turkey. If the Italian incorrectly stabs, then it was going to be a difficult game anyway. 

If the Italian wants to stab, why not invite him in under the 'Modern Borders' theory, wherein Italy assumes ownership of Trieste for the early game.


## No. 47 Not Having a Plan

A stab too early in a game where you need to reach 18 is a big mistake. You need to map out your route to 18. If your stab gets you to 14 and you need 18, then that stab is BAD. 

You might argue that having a bad plan is better than no plan. I might agree with you.

## No. 46 Staying within Your Limits

As soon as your mind is telling you are uncomfortable, you have the opportunity to do something great. 

Maybe you've got yourself into an important conversation, to the moment of that conversation where you have a player across from you open to being persuaded. Well, it might be uncomfortable to say or ask what you are about to say or ask, but just realize you are on the cusp of doing something great for your position.

Don't stay within your limits.

## No. 45 Missing the Flow of the Game

There are inflection points in games that you can often see coming. Now's the time for England to stab Germany. Now's the moment where France puts down a southern fleet. Now's the chance for Austria to nab Rumania.

To miss these inflection points puts you at a disadvantage. 

If you actually are the seed of these strategic imbalances through suggestive negotiation, then you stand to profit even more from your visionary forethought. Channel your inner Paul Atreides.

## No. 44 Letting One Mistake Blow Up Your Game

Fine, you made a mistake. What gives? Your neighbors are going to blunder eventually, too. Diplomacy extracts mistakes from we plebians. Stay cool, patient, and stay in the game. Don't embarrass yourself further by blundering a home center to your opponent in the very next move.

## No. 43 Refusing to Consider Alternatives

The permutations of possible moves each season are plenty. 

The possible ways to approach a given conversation are numerous. 

The paths to a good result are myriad.

Consider your alternatives!

## No. 42 Ignoring Country-Specific Dynamics

Italy is not Austria is not Turkey is not Russia, even though each will be battling in the Balkans.

## No. 41 Avoiding Risk

You've gotta take risks in Diplomacy. Someone may use valuable information against you. But you might have to give it to make the case for the support order you need from a neighbor. That's the risk. 

Tactically, there are few locks on the Diplomacy board. Even when something is a lock, you might consider taking the risk that your opponent believes you'll take the guarantee and do something even better with your spare unit.

## No. 40 Not Eavesdropping

In a face to face game, you are able to see who is talking to whom and with what body language.

Often, information is exchanged right at the end of the clock. 

Pay attention to this!

## No. 39 Oversharing

There is a benefit of sharing your specific moves and showing other players your reliability. 

However, this can be used against you, so be wary of doing this at key junctures. 

## No. 38 Judging People

I'm not talking about making Bayesian probability judgments. 

What I mean is, if you are judging someone's character in real-time as the game progresses, you're probably wasting mental space.

## No. 37 Missing Non-Verbals

The human body communicates.

## No. 36 Opening to Silesia

As either Germany or Russia. Unless there are circumstances. 

In a tournament game I learned Russia was opening to Silesia, because he was close on tournament points to the German player. That made complete sense. Otherwise, a Russian in Silesia doesn't accomplish much besides giving France and England a good early game.

There are several other early game territories that share this character.

I'm not saying you shouldn't ever open to Silesia or Livonia. Actually, making moves like these do allow you to own your narrative by how unusual they look to other players.


## No. 35 Not Owning Your Narrative

Sometimes Diplomacy is a battle of narratives. Narratives about you as a player, about how you play, about what your plans are. 

Don't you want to own your own narrative? Fight back with persuasion when you sense these narrative-altering tactics being used against you.

## No. 34 Not Gaining Knowledge About Stalemate Lines

Especially relevant in the context of the scoring system at work in your particular game. Many of these endgame stalemate positions include Munich, but country by country, they vary. For example, England has a 7-unit stalemate position, and Turkey has a 6-center position.

## No. 33 Forgetting to Share Your Concerns

"I'm concerned about..." 

Then be silent and let your ally explain the situation, or perhaps give you something.

## No. 32 Refreshing Your Perspective

Win, lose, or draw, take time to consider how Diplomacy as a hobby fits into your life. 

Often, you'll come back to the game ready to collaborate, fight, and learn. 

## No. 31 Failing to Adjust Player Reads

Each move in the game gives you a chance to make predictions and check your predictions against your preconcieved models. 

You must adjust your player reads where you were wrong.

If a player is showing good will after previous eradicate or antagonistic play, give them a chance. Maybe.

## No. 30 Letting Yourself Get Angry

Unless as a feint. 

## No. 29 Staying Hydrated and Fed

Especially in tournaments. 

There are exceptions. I once witnessed Zachary Moore order a cheeseburger pre-game and leave it untouched until he board-topped. 

## No. 28 Pretending to Be Someone You're Not

Live within the skillset you have and the preparation you made for this game. 

## No. 27 Coming Across as Less than Confident

Confidence is crucial. Especially for powers like Italy, whose influence is greater in the future years than the immediate season. See Andrew Goff's 'Italian Renaissance' in DW#139. 

## No. 26 Celebrating Too Much

Not celebrating a good draw or victory can be perceived as a slap in your opponents' faces, so don't be shy. But going on to tell your opponents how silly they were to let you board top may not be the right metagame play.

## No. 25 Being a Cad

We're no longer living in Richard Sharp's 1970s Diplomacy landscape where arguably the best policy was to be cad. 

Of course, you can't be a pushover, weak, or lacking confidence, but being a cad is a different dimension. To each their own but for me this is unnecessary and off-putting.

## No. 24 Playing Too Much Online without Playing Face to Face

Even though the hobby flourished in play-by-mail, you owe yourself to try face to face. 

If you enjoy playing online, I expect you'll enjoy face to face. 

See you at the next tournament.

## No. 23 Accepting Conventions

It used to be that Germany often bounced Russia in Sweden. Lately, Germany more often welcomes the Russian fleet to the Swedish port. 

Accepting any or all conventions without thinking through them is to possibly miss strategic opportunities that others have incorrectly accepted, or, that with a minor adjustment, may work quite well in the current zeitgeist.

For my money, the English Channel ought to be occupied about 5% more of the time, and Armenia perhaps as much as 20%. 

How Greece changes hands is not given enough consideration.

## No. 22 Waiving Builds on Purpose

This is hard to justify. If you're unsure whether it's better to build a fleet or an army, flip a coin. 

## No. 21 Waiving Builds on Accident

If you make this goof-up, consider assuring the other players you did so on purpose.

## No. 20 Building Too Many Fleets or Too Many Armies

Your builds are situationally based, taking into account your near-term strategy, relationships, potential for progress and desire to thwart threats.

If possible, keep the right balance for your power's situational context. When you know your opponent's build in advance, you can make your build more confidently. How could you find that out?

## No. 19 Not Throwing the Game...Sometimes

If you don't throw the game sometimes, you can't credibly threat to do this.

I don't like this, but the enemy has to know.

## No. 18 Refusing to Give Gifts

When you make a gesture, present it as a gift. Put an extravagant bow on it. Take the risk of receiving reciprocation for that gift.

## No. 17 Not Shaking Hands

At the end of a 6-hour game, it feels good to shake hands with other humans.

## No. 16 Not Mixing in a Smile

Smiles can diffuse a tense situation efficiently. When used with other persuasive techniques, simply smiling is very effective.

## No. 15 Leaving Charm Behind

There are other kinds of magic, too, but you ought to at least consider your charm. 

## No. 14 Being Dislikable

If you are likeable, you can get away with a lot. Players will want to work with you and they won't mind all that much when they lose versus you. 

## No. 13 Not Joking

In a recent game I ordered F Bul(sc) - Gre with zero chance of it succeeding. When the order was read, I asked, "Did that get in?" which brought chuckles around the table. 

If you are the player who keeps thing light, people are more likely to enjoy playing with you, even if you are a ruthless tactician. 

## No. 12 Refusing to Say Sorry

You made a mistake. It's not weak to apologize.

## No. 11 Not Writing Down Your Orders

To signal you have a deal.

## No. 10 Playing the Same Way with Each Player

Each relationship is different and will be shifting throughout the game. You might argue that bringing the same approach to each relationship keeps things simple. And that's fine. But if you can adjust the way you speak to and with each player based on the power dynamics, that will likely be better.

With relationships come expectations, modes of communication, and the sharing of information. Even in contentious or outright antagonistic relationships, expectations are set, communication occurs (however little), and information passes back and forth.  

As you react to developments around you and sew the seeds of your own flourishing, the creation and management of relationships is paramount to early game success.  


## No. 9 Missing the Morning Shower

If you smell neutral to good, that's great. If you don't, that could be a distraction. 

## No. 8 Deciding Not to Reflect on Your Game

Write an After Action Report. This is where you assess your own play. The play of your opponents. Where did you go wrong? What did you do right? Did you make a mistake in your player reads? Your strategy? Your choice of early-game collaboration? Did you miss an important persuasive opportunity at an inflection point? Did you waive two builds in 1901? 

## No. 7 Forgetting There Are 7 Players in the Game

Your chances of winning are slim. Lower your expectations and raise your success.

## No. 6 Not Embracing the Warrior Mentality

We are lucky that we aren't on the battlefield, actual soldiers in war. In a tough mental game where you can actually influence your opponents, you must be the one who doesn't stand down.

## No. 5 Let him have revenge...or he'll take his revenge later. 

(Commonly understood among top heads-up online poker players...once your opponent is on monkey tilt, you must allow him to play a high-variance style...he may even win back a good chunk of his money, but if you try to protect your winnings by limping or min-raising the button and folding to his preflop three-bets, you will lose your customer. The customer is always right, especially if he is a monkey on a tilted shopping spree.)

If the opponent wants revenge, let him FEEL like he's had his revenge. Otherwise, not yet satisfied, he will seek it indefinitely. 

This is a problem I've noticed among some players in our club, although only because I first noticed seeds of it within my own psyche. You can bet I was confused to find it. In a situation where I should have been comfortable with a clearly mutually beneficial alliance, why was I stand-offish? Why wasn't I seeking easy gains? 

Where some describe this as an ongoing narrative--so and so likes to attack so and so, or that's what that player does--my view is that such a "narrative" usually disguises some other deeper unresolved mechanic or model within a player's mind.

Certainly there are what might be called metagame elements which may enter a game. If you know a player's tendencies, it would be foolish to ignore those, however oversimplifying your model of an opponent might work against you. Better to constantly refresh your models as new information comes in.

## No. 4 Stabbing Weakly or Indecisively

If you stab, make it count. Don't go in half-baked. Make people remember your name.

## No. 3 Not Understanding Realpolitik

Diplomacy is a game that is built on the theory of realpolitik and offensive realism. If you don't protect your security, your opponents will first take the territories adjacent your supply centers. Next season, they'll take your cookies.

## No. 2 Thinking You've Got it Figured Out

The Game of Diplomacy has more secrets for you. If you're willing to look for them. 

## No. 1 Stealing Another Player's Destiny

We would all do well to return again to inspect the models we've built of the game, including our strategic biases with each power, or how we present ourselves as a negotiator. 

Even in teachable moments, it is a fine line between mentoring and stealing another person's destiny.
