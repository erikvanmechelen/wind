# The Fundamentals

My name is Erik and I'll be your guide on this Diplomacy journey. Whether you are a new player entering your first few games face-to-face or online, or simply hoping to step up your game to an intermediate level, you've come to the right place!

For the basics, have a skim or full read of Richard Sharp's [*The Game of Diplomacy*](https://diplomacy-archive.com/god). With knowledge of basic tactics from the first chapter, you'll be ready to absorb everything in this book. Be sure to pay mind to support-cutting, the scissors, braces, and the humorous but useful merry-go-round.

If you're reading a digital version of this book, the following may serve you: 

Here is [PDF of the rulebook](https://www.wizards.com/avalonhill/rules/diplomacy.pdf) from the version of the game I own. 

[This page on WikiBooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Diplomacy/Rules) is useful too.

Brandon Fogel's discussion of [the Tribute Scoring System](https://github.com/erikvanmechelen/diplomacybook/blob/master/2019-07%20-%20Systems%20of%20Value%20in%20Diplomacy%20(Janus)%20v3%20(1).pdf) provides a brief history of scoring systems and advocates for the upcoming Janus approach. (Scoring system was previously called Janus.)

For a highly readable discussion of openings, try 3x World Champion Andrew Goff's [Diplomacy Openings](https://diplomacyopenings.wordpress.com/).

If you're starting a club or local game, to keep new players organized and less overwhelmed, try handing out the [Diplomacy Games Journal - Austria Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1704088372), or [Germany Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1704300924) or [Italy Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1704232562).

To practice online, [Watch this video](https://youtu.be/mgWste5NwNY) on how to get started on [Conspiracy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.badfrog.conspiracy.app&hl=en_US) or open up a sandbox at [backstabbr.com](backstabbr.com).

Prefer to watch high-level players in action, look no further than [Chris Martin's full video recap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPlUuvIV7ws&list=PLbwng27eI0e3O9rIFcXp_Bvr97TNgAsQw) of the World Diplomacy Championships 2016. I'm waiting, and I think I'll be waiting for awhile, to see a better combination of reporting, commentary, and analysis by a World Diplomacy Champion on a top-shelf Diplomacy tournament Top Board.  

## The Nature of Diplomacy

For me, Diplomacy is a 7-player game about area control guided by secret and simultaneous piece movement. The player who most effectively manages and strategically expands his territory wins or takes part in a draw. If we advance the discussion to include game theory, all good strategies include one thing: effective negotiation. In a word, Diplomacy.  

He who can influence his opponents to collaborate at the right moments and misdirect them in others improves his drawing and winning chances. The game is a ritual with comparisons to Machiavellian political philosophy as well as to notions of realpolitik present in the era contemporary to the starting positions of the game: 1901. (For history of 'realpolitik', see the book by Ludwig von Rochau or Kaiser Wilhelm's unification efforts in Germany.)

## Who am I?

I first played Diplomacy at age 15 in 2002, a face-to-face game hosted by my history teacher. After winning as Germany, I started a Diplomacy Club which took over our school. Today, I'm a council member of the [MN Diplomacy Club](https://mndiplomacyclub.com) and earned Player of the Year in the inaugural 2019 season for best overall results. 

I expect to play in the next World Diplomacy Championships, Carnage in 2020.

## Stealing Your Destiny

Winning in Diplomacy is far, far more than ensuring you get your orders written accurately and in the box on time. 

But to give too much away--and believe me, I'm trying--is also double-edged, because it takes away some of the fun of making your own mistakes and discovering new ways that the old guard didn't see. 

This gives you a chance to try new things, like ordering `A Lvp H` (!) for diplomatic reasons.
