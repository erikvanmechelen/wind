# The Fundamentals

My name is Erik and I'll be your guide on this Diplomacy journey. Whether you are a new player entering your first few games face-to-face or online, or simply hoping to step up your game to an intermediate level, you've come to the right place!

For the basics, have a read of [Richard Sharp's _The Game of Diplomacy_](https://diplomacy-archive.com/god). With knowledge of basic tactics from the first chapter, you'll be ready to absorb everything in this book.

If you're reading a digital version of this book, the following may serve you: 

Here is [PDF of the rulebook](https://www.wizards.com/avalonhill/rules/diplomacy.pdf) from the version of the game I own. 

[This page on WikiBooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Diplomacy/Rules) is useful too.

Brandon Fogel's discussion of [the Janus Scoring System](https://github.com/erikvanmechelen/diplomacybook/blob/master/2019-07%20-%20Systems%20of%20Value%20in%20Diplomacy%20(Janus)%20v3%20(1).pdf) provides a brief history of scoring systems and advocates for the upcoming Janus approach.

Prefer to watch high-level players in action, look no further than [Chris Martin's full video recap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPlUuvIV7ws&list=PLbwng27eI0e3O9rIFcXp_Bvr97TNgAsQw) of the World Diplomacy Championships 2016.

## The Nature of Diplomacy

For me, Diplomacy is a 7-player game about area control guided by secret and simultaneous piece movement. The player who most effectively manages and strategically expands his territory wins or takes part in a draw. If we advance the discussion to include game theory, all good strategies include one thing: effective negotiation. In a word, Diplomacy.  

He who can influence his opponents to collaborate at the right moments and misdirect them in others improves his drawing and winning chances. The game is a ritual with comparisons to Machiavellian political philosophy as well as to notions of realpolitik present in the era contemporary to the starting positions of the game: 1901. (For history of 'realpolitik', see the book by Ludwig von Rochau or Kaiser Wilhelm's unification efforts in Germany.)

## Who am I?

I first played Diplomacy at age 15 in 2002, a face-to-face game hosted by my history teacher. After winning as Germany, I started a Diplomacy Club which took over our school. Today, I'm a council member of the MN Diplomacy Club and earned Player of the Year in the inaugural 2019 season for best overall results. 

I expect to play in the next two World Diplomacy Championships, Carnage in 2020 and Thailand 2021.


## Stealing Your Destiny

Diplomacy is far, far more than ensuring you get your orders in on time. 

But to give too much away--and believe me, I'm trying--is also double-edged, because it takes away some of the fun of making your own mistakes and discovering new ways that the old guard didn't see. 

This gives you a chance to try new things, like ordering `A Lvp H` (!) for diplomatic reasons.
