# The Fundamentals

After playing a few games in high school, I read Richard Sharp's [*The Game of Diplomacy*](https://diplomacy-archive.com/god). With knowledge of basic tactics from the first chapter, you'll be ready to absorb everything in this book. Be sure to pay mind to support-cutting, the scissors, braces, and the humorous but useful merry-go-round.

We will review all of that here, too, in addition to important nuances you may find scattered around the net, but consolidated here for your convenience.

Knowing what options and constraints you have allows you to get creative, to better generate strategy, to more ingeniusly approach the diplomacy.


## The Nature of Diplomacy

"Win if you can. Lose if you must. But always cheat."

One of my favorite film directors, Werner Herzog, reminded me of this quote, attributed to Jesse Ventura, a WWE wrestler and former governor of my home state, Minnesota. While it may provide a catchy tagline (or even approach to good play) for a game like Diplomacy, it doesn't describe WHAT the essence of Diplomacy is. 

How you think of the game of Diplomacy frames how you play it. So, it is important to ask: how are you assembling your model of what the game of Diplomacy is?

In my case, that foundation was laid through an introduction to the game in my sophomore-year high school history class, and later through the DPJudge, through the club I setup in high school, and subsequent online and club games in Minnesota after meeting Ben Johnson, Zachary Moore, and Jake Langenfeld over a decade later. The model was picked up experientially versus theoretically. I don't recall thinking about the game abstractly, in a top-down approach, but rather from a bottom-up approach through game after game with a variety of players. To think about the game from a top-down level, I have to sit apart from the overpowering models of that bottom-up approach, which isn't easy to do. 

But here goes:

For me, that Diplomacy is a 7-player game focused on area control guided by secret and simultaneous piece movement. The player who most effectively manages and strategically expands his territory wins or takes part in a draw. 

The game is a ritual with comparisons to Machiavellian political philosophy as well as to notions of realpolitik present in the era contemporary to the starting positions of the game: 1901. (For history of 'realpolitik', see the book by Ludwig von Rochau or Kaiser Wilhelm's unification efforts in Germany.)

If you take as reasonable my description above, then we can proceed into a discussion of what to do given these game conditions. 

We can say things like: The player who can influence their opponents to collaborate at the right moments and misdirect them in others improves the player's drawing and winning chances. 

If we advance the discussion to include game theory, all good strategies include one thing: effective negotiation. In a word, diplomacy. 

But HOW should this diplomacy be carried out. Sure, a given game master (GM) or Tournament Director (TD) will detail which ruleset and which guidelines (or house rules) are to be followed. However, the game rules itself do not restrict almost any behavior, negotiation styles, or approaches to the game. 

In a game whose explicit rule-set is quite open-ended surrounding the most important aspect--the diplomacy--it 

Norms about negotiation may exist in your subculture or the dominating culture of the game, but those are just that, norms in the zeitgeist, rather than bedrock or universal truths about the game.

Let's take a common class of diplomatic interference: interjecting into another ongoing negotiation between other players.

At a recent masked face to face game in my backyard in south Minneapolis, one player was intentionally butting into a conversation I was having. Of course I found it annoying, but it also cut into the amount of time and the clarity with which I could persuade or make plans with my would-be collaborator. How is not this a good move from the distracting party? 

You might argue that this tactic is underhanded or irritating. But it achieved its result! 

You might argue that because it is underhanded or irritating, that I am less likely to want to work with that particular player going forward, given this undesireably 'dishonorable' behavior. Maybe so. But in that case, that is a risk the player employing that tactic takes on. 

There is an alternative way to think about this, which is, that players may take on personas, or masks, or outfits, while engaged in a game. That is, from this view, we should expect players to do whatever it is that fits that persona, or that is acceptable within that perception of that player's persona, and not carry ill-will towards that approach. 

Watching how your opponents react to various approaches to the simple act of having a conversation, or conducting their diplomacy, will give you a clue as to how they think about the game. From there, you might deduce an approach that will give you an edge in your diplomatic relations with them. 

How you think > what you think. 

"Win if you can. Lose if you must. But always cheat."


## Stealing Your Destiny

Winning in Diplomacy is far, far more than ensuring you get your orders written accurately and in the box on time. 

But to give too much away--and believe me, I'm trying--is also double-edged, because it takes away some of the fun of making your own mistakes and discovering new ways that the old guard didn't see. 

This gives you a chance to try new things, like ordering `A Lvp H` (!) for diplomatic reasons. 

## Tactics

Here we discuss movement, bounces, supports, support-cutting, retreats, unwanted supports, convoys, and builds.

Fairly simple rules--only 4 options for any unit--and the constraint of one unit per territory lead to many beautiful options for each player in any given season of Diplomacy. The anticipation prior to orders being read is one of the best moments on offer in gaming.

### Movement and Intro to Supporting

Armies move between land territories. Fleets along coasts and bodies of water. 

A unit, army or fleet, can support any army or fleet moving to a territory that the supporting unit itself *could* otherwise move. It is not necessary for the units to be adjacent one another. A unit may be supported by multiple other units. 

A common opening, should France desire to guarantee ownership of Burgundy by Fall 1901, is A Par - Bur with A Mar S Par - Bur. Even if Germany plays A Mun - Bur, the French army from Paris arrives in Burgundy with a strength of 2 vs the unsupported German army arriving from Munich with a strength of 1.

Players may support their own and other players' units. Both are useful. 

### How Orders are Read & Adjudicated

All orders, no matter the sequence of their reading, are said to occur simultaneously. Aside from a small handful of paradoxes, successfully adjudicating orders by hand in a face-to-face game quickly becomes second nature. 

However, for new players, keep in mind that because all moves are said to occur simultaneously. You don't get into a territory simply by moving there 'before' me (based on which player's orders are read first) so long as I have also ordered a unit there. 

Generally, if no gamemaster is present to adjudicate, players will take turns reading orders for each player, beginning with their own. Starting with one's own orders prevents the reader from verbally changing his orders after announcing another player's orders (that he didn't like). Whatever orders are legibly written on the order sheet or notebook is final. 

As in life, anticipation is often better than the real thing. We humans, as poet David Whyte has put it, are in constant anticipation of arrival. The arrival is usually a relief or disappointment rather than elation.

### Bounces

When I was still creating YouTube videos, I opted to end them with a parting "Bounce you soon!", a variation of Chris Martin's "I'll stab you soon" to close his own excellent videos.

Bounces are frequent. This is in part because of the rule restricting one unit for one territory, and in part because of the unit density (the number of units relative to the territories available to move through on the game board). Certain territories are critical and are often occupied through much of a game. Others, like Clyde or the Adriatic Sea, are more situational. 

A bounce occurs anytime at least two units attempt to occupy the same territory, with equal strength. 

Perhaps the most common early game bounce is in the Black Sea. 

Turkey orders F Ank - BLA and Russia orders F Sev - BLA. 

Bounces can help you defend a key territory while also ultimately maintaining the territory in which a unit sits. Consider Germany arranging a bounce with France in Burgundy in Spring 1901.

Bounces may also be used to help an ally. 

Imagine this situation, where Austria should like to disguise an alliance with Russia whilst defending against a potential Italian stab. 

Austria: 
A Tri - Vie

Russia: 
A Gal - Vie

Italy: 
A Ven - Tri

The Austrian and Russian armies bounce. The Austrian army then returns to Trieste, where it bounces with the incoming Italian army from Venice. If this is a Fall turn, Austria will now be able to build in Vienna. If Austria had desired to build in Trieste (perhaps seeking a fleet build), he would have had to vacate Trieste, but in this example would have been foiled by A Ven - Tri. 

#### Self-Bouncing

Self-bouncing (referred to as the scissors by Richard Sharp) effectively allows a player to defend three territories with only two units. Often used to defend a home center whilst keeping it open for a Winter build. 

You might also use the self-bounce to both defend an already-owned center and keep a new center taken in the Spring.

Or, more simply, you may wish to hold onto gains and defend access to pivotal territories:

France has an army in Belgium and Marseille, with an English fleet in NTH, a German army in Mun, and an Italian army in Pie. By ordering A Bel - Bur and A Mar - Bur, France can safely protect Burgundy and hold Belgium and Marseille from his neighbors' potential prods. 


#### The Brace

When two units attempt to switch places, both with equal strength of two (or more), they remain home. This is known as a brace. 

Why not call this a bounce? It is very similar to a bounce, but is distinguished from the average bounce in that the starting positions of the moving units are adjacent. 


#### Beleaguered Garrison

The beleaguered garrison rule, which states that if a province is attacked from two (or more) sides by equal forces, any unit occupying the province cannot be dislodge, even if it is weaker than all the individual attackers.

Imagine a German army has reached Galicia but both Austria and Russia should like to occupy that territory. 

Austria: 
A Vie - Gal
A Bud S Vie - Gal

Russia: 
A War - Gal
A Ukr S War - Gal

Germany: 
A Gal - Vie

The result here is that the German army in Gal is the beleaguered garrison--not only surrouned but attack from two parties each with a strength of two. However, neither the Austrian nor Russian armies gain Galicia. The German army is not dislodged and stays put. 

### Building

When, at the end of a Fall season--the beginning of Winter--a player's supply center count is greater than that player's current unit count, that player may build in any unoccupied home center. Armies in land territories. Fleets on any coastal territory. 

Players may waive builds (save them for later), but this is risky given the fact that player may lose one or more supply centers that very next year.

The building rules, which extend from the end of Fall center counts, lend to a considerable amount of the tactics and strategy available in Diplomacy. After neutral centers are gained, usually by end of 1902, any center gained for one power is a center lost by another. 

Most game types do not allow for negotiation during Winter seasons, which means players must analyze the outcomes from the Fall moves and place their builds without further discussion. 

Opening home centers for builds at key moments is a crucial aspect of tactics and strategy as well. (See the upcoming 'unwanted support' in this chapter.)

If during a Winter phase a player's units exceed that player's owned supply centers, that player must remove units to equalize. Any units the players owns may be disbanded (removed from the board). As removals take place during the same Winter phase as builds, there is no negotiation. Choose your removal wisely. 

### Supports Continued

Supports may be **cut** by any unit attacking the territory of the unit providing support. 

A unit may not cut the support of a unit supporting an attack on the original unit. 

Imagine France has armies in Ruhr and Burgundy and Germany has an army in Munich. France orders A Ruh - Mun and A Bur S Ruh - Mun. Germany does not save himself with A Mun - Bur (or A Mun - Ruh; two units may not trade places). The army in Munich is dislodged and must retreat if possible. 

#### Unwanted Support

Usually, when your neighbor supports one of your units, to move or to hold, it is a good thing. But sometimes, you don't want the support you end up getting. 

Suppose France hopes to free up Marseille for a Winter build. 

France:
A Mar - Gas
A Spa - Mar
A Bur - Mar (intending to self-bounce and also prevent Italian A Pie - Mar) 

Italy:
A Pie S Bur - Mar (!)

The result? 

French A Bur - Mar succeeds, which covers Marseille, preventing a build there.

If France was hoping to build a fleet, this scenario might represent the rare scenario where it is acceptable to waive a build. The option of waiving a build is usually a tremendous luxury. 

### Movement Continued

Here are several more types of movement that involve multiple units. 

#### Chain Movement

This refers to any time you move a sequence of units, beginning with the first moving into an adjacent territory, with the others backfilling one after the other. 

Chain moves, when pulled off, are powerful. 

When the lead unit in a chain is bounced, however, every other unit in that chain is bounced back to its starting point as well. 

#### Merry Go Round

Three units may exchange territories in a triangle pattern


### Convoys

The last kind of movement sees a fleet convoy an army through a body of water. 

Imagine the English player hopes to take Belgium in Fall 1901 (ambitious). He might followup his Spring orders with: 

A Wal - Bel
F ENG C Wal - Bel (C = Convoy)
F NTH S Wal - Bel

Wal - Bel succeeds unless France and/or Germany also put a supported unit into Bel. This could occur as follows: Germany orders Ruh - Bel and is supported by France's Bur S Ruh - Bel, we have a bounce--2 vs 2--and the English army returns to Wales.

The above is for example only. This set of moves is unusual in Fall 1901 as it means that England is not going for the neutral, Norway. 

#### Disrupting a Convoy

A convoy is disrupted if the convoying fleet is dislodged. 

Let's imagine the above actually occurred in Fall 1901, and France builds a fleet in Brest in Winter 1901. 

English tries the convoy again, but France dislodges the fleet with F Bre - ENG and F MAO S Bre - ENG. (The convoy fails--the army in Wales stays in Wales--and the English F ENG must retreat.)

#### The Bunny Hop

While two units may not trade places, even F Por with F Spa(sc), you may convoy a unit 'around' another. 

Play this out: 

Italy: 
A Pie - Mar
F LYO C Pie - Mar

France: 
A Mar - Pie
F Spa(sc) - LYO

Leaving aside France's dubious orders, the result is Italy's army in Piedmont moves around or bunny hops the French army going east, and lands in Marseille. 

### Retreats & Disbands

Retreats take place when a unit is dislodged. 

A unit may retreat to any adjacent territory that is both unoccupied and where there were also no bounces that season. The unit may also be immediately disbanded (removed from the board).

There is no negotiation during retreat phases. If retreats for more than one player are to be made, this must be written down (in face-to-face games) or happens without press. 

If two or more units choose to retreat to the same territory, they are both/all removed from the board. 

In a Fall season, it can be useful to disband a dislodged unit and rebuild a new fleet or army in a home center. 

If you are unable to rebuild, retreating to an open territory lets you analyze the board and make the proper disband during the Winter adjustments phase.
