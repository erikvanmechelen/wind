# How to Solo

The conditions for soloing are rare, or, at least, they should be, in a well-played game.

I did not say near-soloing or getting to 14 centers, which is rather more common. 

Solos are rare and beautiful.

In most scoring systems, solos are heavily rewarded, so if there is a chance of going for a solo without ruining relationships for, say, subsequent rounds of the tournament, you are often incentivized to attempt a shot at it.

Hanging out with Ali and Zach at a local bar while checking the updates from the ongoing Round 2 game of WeaselMoot XIII in Chicago, April 2019, wherein Cori eventually soloed as Turkey after stabbing multiple players (Ali being one of them) was a joy to behold. (It must be said that Cori knew how to play, especially for example, saying things in earshot of others who were eavesdropping to throw them off whilst hiding that she was doing so.) It was equally thrilling to see my fellow Minnesotan Zachary Moore solo with Germany in Round 3 of the same tournament to simultaneously win the tournament.  

But solos should probably not be so frequent.  

Below are simply my personal thoughts on possible conditions for soloing. Any of #2-6 might lean you toward attempting the solo.  

1-A clear path to 18 centers (If you've achieved this, the one or several of the below were likely already in play)
2-Sufficient disorganization amongst the remaining players
3-At least one player who does not mind that you solo (so as to punish other players or to reward your good play)
4-At least one player who is capable of misordering or blundering the establishing of the stalemate lines
5-Scoring conditions which incentivize certain players helping you to solo
6-A player who enjoys assisting other players to board-tops and solos

T> In [MNDC2020: Game 1](https://www.backstabbr.com/sandbox/MNDC2020-01/4537400859033600) I played as England. Do you think this could lead to a soloable position? Note that I built three fleets as I thought we would play one more year under time constraints, but the game was voted a draw before Spring 1909 negotiations. If I was playing for a solo, I may not have built three fleets. (The Minnesota Diplomacy Club currently plays under Sum-of-Squres scoring.)

T> In [MNDC2020: Game 4](https://www.backstabbr.com/game/Private-Minnesota-Game-IV/5893925321048064) I played as Germany, reaching 14 centers by Winter 1909. Do you think this could lead to a soloable position?

Please note: I don't believe I've ever soloed in a proper game of Diplomacy.

Good luck as you too seek the elusive solo.
