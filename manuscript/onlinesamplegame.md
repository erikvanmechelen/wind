# Playing Diplomacy Online

From my negative review of online play in this book's opening, you might be surprised to find more discussion of it. I'll do you one better: a sample (actual) game I played with members of the Minnesota Diplomacy Club in the first part of 2020. 

## The Game Conditions

Understand who you are playing with and under what rules and norms. 

All the players know each other and most of us if not all had played at least one game together. So, we would kno *who* is in the game, but not which *Great Power* each player would be commanding. 

Backstabbr in our case provided us with:

- Daily, 24-hour moves (Build and Retreat phases take half the adjudication period)
- Normal press rules (press disabled in Build and Retreat phases)
- 

## How the Game Started

I drew **Austria**, which was fine by me. From a certain point of view, Austria is the best country. 

If Italy was open to it, I wanted to try a **Modern Borders** concept, so I led assertively in my negotiations with most players. For example, notice the subject-line of my first letter to Italy.

As you'll see, in my negotiations I sought out a kind of Austrian Anschluss. See Richard Sharp for a longer discussion of the German Anschluss, whereby Germany keeps on good terms with Austria but otherwise seeds doubt among neighbors and profits from sitting back and waiting for fights to start elsewhere.

Any Italian should seriously consider this approach. Even if the alliance is not a long-term one--which alliances are?--a high-probability of building 2 (I would try to persuade him to build 2 fleets) and reducing tensions with Austria from the outset opens doors and gives even more flexibility to the Italian, who, in the game of Diplomacy, benefits from his ability to strategically influence the game a few moves in advance. 

Here's a link to Diplomacy Games Podcast Episode #61, where I discuss Modern Borders as well. (Modern Borders is attributed to Andrew Goff, at least it is from him I first heard of it, and subsequently set out to test it myself in actual gameplay.)

Next up, I exchanged messages with Turkey.

*It should be noted that in online play, especially with asynchronous information and players finding time throughout their day to negotiate, that waiting to hear from certain players before proceeding with the next conversation is a major consideration. To avoid sitting at my computer all day, I opted for a more assertive approach in Spring 1901 to drive our conversations to specific goals.*

Notice the request the Sultan makes: 

S> Turkey in spring 1901
S> 
S> I would consider a partnership with you. I will commit to move Smyrna to Armenia if you commit to move Vienna to Trieste. What do you say?

The phrasing "I will commit...if you commit" reminds me of a certain player in the game, possibly two. It may be difficult to work effectively with him if I agree and then violate this agreement, however the chance of starting a fight between Russia and Turkey is worth it, even if I opt for what I eventually did: 

A Vie - Bud
A Bud - Ser
F Tri - Alb

What remains unexplained is the request of A Vie - Tri. 

Is the Turk asking for this so that he can tip of Russia that Galicia will be open? In my case, this is worth the risk because of a soon-to-be-had negotiation with Russia, where we arrange a DMZ anyway. A minor point, but pre-empting the 'intel' of another player removes the ability of your neighbors to score diplomatic points with one another, often important when creating trust in a game where trust is necessary but hard to create and maintain.

"Good, Smy - Arm and Vie - Tri will signal that our partnership is a go." 

Notice that the Turk hasn't actually committed to A Smy - Arm. I'm hoping he opts for it. 

### Sending England North

Keeping in mind I am pushing for A Mos - StP, If I can send England north, that will ensure he gets into Norway, which will set up the tension in 1902 and 1903 I want between England and Russia.

![England mentions a DMZ with France](/resources/2020back_england1901s2.png)

I was curious if the DMZ discussion with France was a partial result of my own discussion with France. I had planted a similar seed with France regarding Russian A Mos - StP and the natural English response of F Edi - NWG and F Lon - NTH, which leaves the English Channel open to a French fleet, if necessary. 

I don't know exactly why I would tip off France to this possibility, except to create a good speaking relationship with him, as at one point in the mid-game I may like to work with him against my early game ally, Italy. 


### France to the Channel?

I don't know exactly why I would tip off France to this possibility, except to create a good speaking relationship with him, as at one point in the mid-game I may like to work with him against my early game ally, Italy. 

As you can see, not much information is exchanged between he and I. 

![Rumors and pleasantries, while they last](/resources/2020back_france1901s.png)

Notice that I do not ask him about Belgium, which I opt to wait to do in the Fall, as a possible conversation point to try to better understand the dynamics of the Western Triangle. 

*A small but important side-benefit of **Modern Borders** and a Russian going north is that the approach heads off the powerful **Western Triple** which is game-theoretically strong and straightforward to organize in the opening.* 


### Germany Onside

The German and I are onside to begin the game.

![Let's take them all down, says Germany](/resources/2020back_germany1901s2.png)

I'm not sure what asking for A Mun - Tyr accomplishes except that it might get Germany to speak with Italy about same. 

In this game I was early to press, and was able to start every conversation except that with Germany, who also had the following thread with me. 

![Germany wants an alliance](/resources/2020back_germany1901s3.png)

Pretty standard so far. 

### The Bear 


The last message I sent was actually to Russia. Even though I strategically would like to make Russian centers my own, eventually, I should be careful to keep things cordial and not give away my intentions. Things can change quickly in a game of Diplomacy and it is foolish to close off options so soon, especially in Spring 1901. 

![Looking to send Russia north into conflict with England](/resources/2020back_russia1901s.png)

"Are you 100% comfortable with the DMZ in Gal?" 

The way this sentence was framed made me suspect that Russia might be played by MN Club President, Ben Johnson, as he uses similar phrasing when confirming attendance to our face-to-face league games. This *could* be used by others, as impersonation, though I thought it unlikely. Someone else could easily use a construction like this, however. 

If I gave a 40% probability to Russia being played by Ben Johnson, should this change my approach? Should it change how I regard negotiation over Galicia? 

I was actually considering negotiating the DMZ and then taking Galicia myself, which could then be used profitably to take Rumania in Fall 1901. 

But, having further considered that an English-Russian conflict was quite good for me, I wanted to give the Russian player space to develop that conflict, hopefully with a northern build, perhaps even F Stp(nc). If I moved to Galicia, the build would more likely come in Warsaw or Moscow in Winter 1901. 

I therefore switched my order to A Vie - Bud to keep my agreement with Russia while setting up to take Rumania if so desired. You might ask, *If my intention was to have the option of taking Rumania anyway, wouldn't the build Russia gets--if he gets Sweden--have to be in Warsaw or Moscow?* This would be a good question. One way to look at it first from the taking of Rumania. If I've honored an agreement with Russia and he ends up with A Ukr and F Sev (after bouncing), he may even be inclined to ask for my support into Rumania, while sending F Sev to bounce once more in Fall 1901. I can then opt to support him in for now, if I don't mind the early collaboration with Russia, seeing as I can angle for a northern build to entangle him with England. Or, else, I can ensure Turkey doesn't gain the Black Sea whilst taking Rumania myself with A Bud - Rum and A Ser S Bud - Rum.

The image of the above conversation is cut off. There are two more messages: 

S> Russia in spring 1901
S>
S> Agreed. Do you think we can keep Italy on our side for long enough?
S>
S> Austria in spring 1901
S>
S> Negotiating with him and hoping we can come to an arrangement.
