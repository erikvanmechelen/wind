## How to Win Player of the Year (and How to Be a Good Loser)

The Minnesota Diplomacy Club is a very early stage club. Even though I'm pleased with having over 30 players compete across 18 games in 2019, I'd love to see even more players and better quality of play. 

To my way of thinking, the top 7 players in the standings merely had to play a solid style while capitalizing on small mistakes or outright blunders by other players. I freely admit this somewhat diminishes my Player of the Year achievement. Let us place a small asterisk against it--but not dismiss it entirely--as the quality of our club's best players is certainly modest at worst, as our 2019 Top Board suggested. Further, one of our club's best players--Ted Tanner--only played in three games in 2019, and it was a shame not to see him on the Top Board for lack of attendance.

To say it another way, I'm confident that at present it would be easier to find yourself in the top 7 in Minneapolis and St. Paul than in Chicago. 

We have plans to gradually chip away at this deficit. My personal motivation is to increase the level of play so that all players benefit from the toughest competition possible. 

I don't really have much to offer in the way of winning Player of the Year. You have to have the basics: understand the scoring system, understand the players you are playing against, and play the best Diplomacy you can, assessing your own play after each and every game...Where did you misread your opponent? Where was your strategy insufficient? Where did you make a tactical blunder? 

Perhaps more than anything, to become Player of the Year, you have to learn how to be a Good Loser.

What? You mean it's not all about winning?

Obviously, you can't win every game in a 7-person competition. Therefore, you will often be losing or drawing.

So, what is a good loser?

A good loser...is interested 

In being a good loser.
In learning.
In acknowledging other players outplayed him or her. 
In seeking feedback. 
In creating relationships outside the game. 
In laughing together with people about blunders. 
In see people as humans, not merely opponents in the just-finished game.
In ...
In ...
In injecting humor into what is sometimes an overly serious event. 
In taking perspective. 
In admitting mistakes. 
In congratulating winners and providing consolation to those who didn't. 
In teaching
In being taught
In taking ownership (for your play, for your actions, for your behavior)
In ... 
In ... 
In being fun to play with (if you can and if you want to be)
..
..
In being a good loser. 

What does being a good loser ultimately mean? It amounts to the game of Diplomacy, that is, the EVENT of a game, being more than a zero-sum experience. Something happened, and all participants walk away BETTER for that experience, win, lose, or draw. 

After one of our games, I spoke with George Linkert, who read an early draft of this book. We spoke for fifteen minutes, face to face. It was a pleasant discussion. He talked about his work with ... disabled, music, and also why he plays Diplomacy... I thank him for reminding me about the humanity of Diplomacy, and games in general, for reminding why we engage ourselves in these rituals time and again.

In this way, the experience

Be likeable, be a good loser. 

Help people. 

Talk to people before and after the game. 

Build relationships. 

Be fun to play with. 

THIS WILL BE DIFFERENT FOR EVERY CLUB. 

Being "nice", not something I'm necessarily in favor of for its own sake, is at least not an unreasonable default mode of behavior, and is rewarded by many.

making it unpleasant to stab you...

making it pleasant to stab you...

if someone knows it is pleasant, you can invite the stab and use that stab against them, with other players' help. (see Andrew Goff in 2018, top board WDC as England)



I'm not saying you should try to lose. 

In a club format, you will lose some of the time...
