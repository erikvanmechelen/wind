# How to Win Player of the Year (and How to Be a Good Loser)

The Minnesota Diplomacy Club is a very early stage club. Even though I'm pleased with having over 30 players compete across 18 games in 2019, I'd love to see even more players and better quality of play.

To my way of thinking, to reach the top 7 in 2019, players merely had to play a solid style while capitalizing on small mistakes or outright blunders by other players. I freely admit this somewhat diminishes my Player of the Year achievement. Let us place a small asterisk against it--but not dismiss it entirely--as the quality of our club's best players is certainly modest at worst, as our 2019 Top Board suggested. Further, one of our club's best players--Ted Tanner--only played in three games in 2019, and it was a shame not to see him on the Top Board for lack of attendance (our Club scoring system incentivizes players to play four games across the season).  

To say it another way, I'm confident that at present it would be easier to find yourself in the top 7 in Minnesota than in Chicago. 

We have plans to gradually chip away at this deficit. My personal motivation is to increase the level of play so that all players benefit from the toughest competition possible. If you want to see how the club got this point, have a read of [Zachary Moore's article from Diplomacy World #148](http://www.diplomacyworld.net/pdf/dw148.pdf).  

I don't really have much to offer in the way of winning Player of the Year. You have to have the basics: understand the scoring system, understand the players you are playing against, and play the best Diplomacy you can, assessing your own play after each and every game...Where did you misread your opponent? Where was your strategy insufficient? Where did you make a tactical blunder?  

You probably already read the chapter on Scoring Systems, so refer back to that for additional notes on the Tribute scoring system which both the Minnesota Diplomacy Club and The Windy City Weasels are using this year. The system was developed in Chicago. 

Perhaps more than anything, to become Player of the Year, you have to learn how to be a Good Loser.  

What? You mean it's not all about winning?  

Obviously, you can't win every game in a 7-person competition. Therefore, you will often be losing or drawing.  

So, what is a good loser?  

A good loser...is interested in:

### Being a good loser

Losing gratiously is a skill and promotes a positive environment.

### Learning

If you are too busy telling another player how awful their play was, or how many mistakes they made, you will have less attention to examine your own play. 

I personally like to ask how other players were thinking about certain situations, approaching tough moments with curiosity instead of venom. 

### Acknowledging other players outplayed him or her

Since you may not be privy to everything another player was thinking, or indeed to the information they had at hand, it is possible you were outplayed. If you see yourself as an experienced player, it may be difficult to admit that you were outplayed. But letting go of your ego in these cases may open you up to congratulating your opponent.

### Seeking feedback 

One of my favorite things to do is ask for feedback from other players post-game.

If you acknowledge a mistake, a player may even be more forthcoming about ways you could have played better. 

Be sure to be clear about what feedback you're seeking: Do you want feedback on your negotiation style, your strategy, your tactical decision?

### Creating relationships outside the game

Any time you can improve a relationship outside the game, the better for your culture, and maybe the better for future games with a given player.

### Laughing together with people about blunders 

There is nothing like laughter to get over a big mistake. 

### Seeing people as humans, not merely opponents in the just-finished game

Can you separate the game from the post-game? 

### Injecting humor into what is sometimes an overly serious event

Because of how intense and immersive a game of Diplomacy is, especially when played face to face, the skill of injecting humor is a powerful one. 

### Taking perspective 

Try on different perches and lenses.

### Admitting mistakes 

The first step to learning and growth. 

### Congratulating winners and providing consolation to those who didn't 

The cocktail of human emotions is available during and after a game. Showing appreciation and consoloation where appropriate is encouraged. 

### Teaching

When another person is open to it, consider offering your opinion on their play. Pay attention to how they take it. If they are curious and willing to learn, you might offer more. If they are defensive, maybe now isn't the time.

### Being taught

Of course, if you're open to being taught, Diplomacy can teach you many things. So can other players.

### Taking ownership (for your play, for your actions, for your behavior)

If you said something you didn't mean, it's not weak to apologize. It's also okay to explain your thinking about an in-game situation...not everyone will want to ask you why you did this move or that, but sensing when a player wants to have that story told is a good sense to have.

### Having the quality of being fun to play with (if you can and if you want to be)

Each person can do this in their own way. If you're making the game fun for others, people will be happy to see you and happy to invite you to more games. 

### Being a good loser.  

What does being a good loser ultimately mean? It amounts to the game of Diplomacy, that is, the _event_ of a game, being more than a zero-sum experience. Something happened, and all participants walk away _better_ for that experience, win, lose, or draw.  

After one of our games, I spoke with Minnesota club member George Linkert, who read an early draft of this book. We spoke for fifteen minutes, face to face. It was a pleasant discussion. He talked about his work with people living with disability, about teaching music, and also about why he plays Diplomacy... I thank him for reminding me about the humanity of Diplomacy, and games in general, for reminding why we engage ourselves in these rituals time and again.
