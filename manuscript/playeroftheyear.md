# How to Win Player of the Year (and How to Be a Good Loser)

The Minnesota Diplomacy Club is a very early stage club. Even though I'm pleased with having over 30 players compete across 18 games in 2019, I'd love to see even more players and better quality of play.

To my way of thinking, to reach the top 7 in 2019, players merely had to play a solid style while capitalizing on small mistakes or outright blunders by other players. I freely admit this somewhat diminishes my Player of the Year achievement. Let us place a small asterisk against it--but not dismiss it entirely--as the quality of our club's best players is certainly modest at worst, as our 2019 Top Board suggested. Further, one of our club's best players--Ted Tanner--only played in three games in 2019, and it was a shame not to see him on the Top Board for lack of attendance (our Club scoring system incentivizes players to play four games across the season).  

To say it another way, I'm confident that at present it would be easier to find yourself in the top 7 in Minnesota than in Chicago. 

We have plans to gradually chip away at this deficit. My personal motivation is to increase the level of play so that all players benefit from the toughest competition possible. If you want to see how the club got this point, have a read of [Zachary Moore's article from Diplomacy World #148](http://www.diplomacyworld.net/pdf/dw148.pdf).  

I don't really have much to offer in the way of winning Player of the Year. You have to have the basics: understand the scoring system, understand the players you are playing against, and play the best Diplomacy you can, assessing your own play after each and every game...Where did you misread your opponent? Where was your strategy insufficient? Where did you make a tactical blunder?  

You probably already read the chapter on Scoring Systems, so refer back to that for additional notes on the Tribute scoring system which both the Minnesota Diplomacy Club and The Windy City Weasels are using this year. The system was developed in Chicago. 

Perhaps more than anything, to become Player of the Year, you have to learn how to be a Good Loser.  

What? You mean it's not all about winning?  

Obviously, you can't win every game in a 7-person competition. Therefore, you will often be losing or drawing.  

So, what is a good loser?  

A good loser...is interested in:

### Being a good loser

Losing gratiously is a skill and promotes a positive environment.

### Learning

If you are too busy telling another player how awful their play was, or how many mistakes they made, you will have less attention to examine your own play. 

I personally like to ask how other players were thinking about certain situations, approaching tough moments with curiosity instead of venom. 

### Acknowledging other players outplayed him or her

Since you may not be privy to everything another player was thinking, or indeed to the information they had at hand, it is possible you were outplayed. If you see yourself as an experienced player, it may be difficult to admit that you were outplayed. But letting go of your ego in these cases may open you up to congratulating your opponent.

### Seeking feedback 

### Creating relationships outside the game

### Laughing together with people about blunders 

### Seeing people as humans, not merely opponents in the just-finished game

### Injecting humor into what is sometimes an overly serious event

### Taking perspective 

### Admitting mistakes 

### Congratulating winners and providing consolation to those who didn't 

### Teaching

### Being taught

### Taking ownership (for your play, for your actions, for your behavior)

### Having the quality of being fun to play with (if you can and if you want to be)

### Being a good loser.  

What does being a good loser ultimately mean? It amounts to the game of Diplomacy, that is, the _event_ of a game, being more than a zero-sum experience. Something happened, and all participants walk away _better_ for that experience, win, lose, or draw.  

After one of our games, I spoke with Minnesota club member George Linkert, who read an early draft of this book. We spoke for fifteen minutes, face to face. It was a pleasant discussion. He talked about his work with people living with disability, about teaching music, and also about why he plays Diplomacy... I thank him for reminding me about the humanity of Diplomacy, and games in general, for reminding why we engage ourselves in these rituals time and again.
