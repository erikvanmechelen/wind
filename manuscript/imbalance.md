# Beautiful Imbalances

I've made a few games with my brothers and so I enjoy analyzing a game from the designer's perspective. Participating in local IGDA events or design events like Protospiel has taught me more about how to approach games critically. 

The more I play, look at, and think about Diplomacy, the more beautiful imbalances I see. Like a guitar, whose harmonics arise from imperfections, Diplomacy may be the wonder it is by virtue of these quirks in its design.  

It might seem odd to begin the book this way, but as the writer I want to provide the reader something fresh, so that even if you only complete this chapter and no more, you might have come to see something differently, and your time will have been well spent. 

In this chapter we'll discuss unit mix at game start, the proximity to stalemate lines of neutral supply centers, the relative position of home centers to stalemate lines, supply center density, and unit density. All this will set us up for a more rigorous discussion of the coordination problem in the following chapter.

After reading this chapter, you'll understand why Turkey doesn't start the game with F Smy and why Italy and France don't often do well when they fight each other. You'll also see that since England and Turkey are behind stalemate lines, their existence retains uncertainty and imbalance in a game's board texture, as problematic and powerful as a rook on the seventh rank in a game of chess.

(In a previous version of this book, I had labeled this section 'Inequality', which was not only innacurate but also risked readers believing I was somehow in favor of all forms of inequality.)

## Unit Mix at Game Start 

What if Turkey started the game with A Con, F Ank, and F Smy ? Suddenly Greece isn't leaning Austrian and the Ionian Sea is under threat in Fall 1901...Italy would have to think twice about playing F ION - Tun and might more often opt for the safer F ION C Apu - Tun. And _then_, if it became standard for Italy to take Tunis with the army, you might even see moves like Turkish F AEG S Alb - ION, both breaking up the convoy and dislodging the Italian fleet (likely to Tunis). The Turkish support for Austrian F Alb - ION might be in exchange for Greece. 

All this speculation is to show that a Turk beginning the game with F Smy, versus having to wait till Winter 1901 to build it, makes Turkey stronger by virtue of the immediate unopposed F Smy - AEG. 

With such an opening setup, Russia is also stronger because Turkey cannot even threaten to play A Smy - Arm. Would this lead to the Juggernaut (Russian/Turkish alliance) being used with even more regularity? 

My guess is that Calhamer and his playtesters considered and probably even explored situations like the above. It was probably the right decision to keep England and Russia as the two powers with two fleets to start the game.


## Relative Position of Neutrals

Notice the relative position of each neutral supply center to each Great Power's home centers. Now consider those same neutral supply centers relative to stalemate lines. By Mark Berch, [here is one of my favorite articles](http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/strategy/articles/stalemate_lines.htm) on stalemate lines.

Let's take them one by one. 

**Norway**: Immediately adjacent to Saint Petersburg but a natural neutral for England. 
**Holland**: Usually Germany's but also adjacent the North Sea.
**Denmark**: Usually Germany's but also adjacent the North Sea and Sweden in 1902 on.
**Sweden**: Either empty with a German bounce (A Den - Swe) or Russia's, adjacent to English-owned Norway and German-owned *Denmark* in 1902 on.
**Belgium**: Could stay neutral in 1901 or go to any of France, Germany, or England.
**Spain**: France's, and quite safe from neighbors.
**Portugal**: France's, relatively safe as well.
**Tunis**: Italy's, with reasonable medium-term security. 
**Serbia**: Austria's, adjacent to five other supply centers in the Balkans.
**Greece**: Usually Austria's, but occasionally Italy's or Turkey's, after 1901 its ownership is in question.
**Rumania**: Most often Russia's, at least in 1901. 
**Bulgaria**: As close to a sure thing for Turkey as Spain is for France.

Obviously, the neutrals seem necessary to gather so as to build additional units. For some great powers, capturing them does require risk, the risk of pulling your units out of useful defensive positions. The most obvious being Austrian F Tri - Alb on its way to Greece. If Austria can pull this off, win Greece and not lose Tri, he will likely build two and also have his F Gre in a useful position to work with either of Italy or Turkey. 

For France, gathering the Iberian neutrals could leave Burgundy exposed. It's rare to see a Russian A War - Sil in Spring 1901, but a German positioning for Den, Hol, and perhaps Bel is severely weakened by A War - Sil. (The German would likely bounce Russian F GOB - Swe if Russia opens with A War - Sil.) In the German case, trying for additional leverage on Belgium with A Mun - Ruh does leave a question for Munich if France opens to Burgundy. 

This is a partial list of risks. You can probably see a few more with minimal difficulty. For a statistical analysis of which powers overall position improves by taking ownership of specific centers in 1901 or 1902, see [this article by Josh Burton](http://uk.diplom.org/pouch/Zine/S2007R/Burton/statistician2.htm).  

If you've succeeded in gaining the neutral/s, you are rewarded with a build! This solves part of the vulnerability you created in moving toward the neutrals and away from your home centers. However, once the neutrals are all captured, the game is suddenly a zero-sum affair. Lose a center, lose a unit. 

Because of the game design, we now have several imbalances which cause tension. Norway, owned by England unless he has been Sea Lioned (Fall 1901: F Den to NTH, A StP - Nwy, and even worse if France has taken the English Channel), is adjacent Russia's home center of Saint Petersburg. How will Russia and England ever relieve this tension?  

Germany's ownership of Holland and Denmark, in conjunction with England's F NTH, will long be cause for diplomacy between those two players. 

Austria's gain in Serbia seems safe enough, but Greece is less stable. Rumania, if held by Russia, is potentially under fire from Bud, Ser, and Bul. Or is Turkey's just-gained Bulgaria at risk to a combined Austrian-Russian effort? In [Josh Burton's statistical analysis](http://uk.diplom.org/pouch/Zine/S2007R/Burton/statistician2.htm), there is evidence that Russia's game improves dramatically with ownership of Sweden, and reasonably with ownership of Rumania, but less so.

I also now invite you to consider the relative positions of the neutral supply centers (and groupings of neutrals) that you and your neighbors own to common stalemate lines. The board is _not_ setup in such a way that 7 players sit in a grand circle around supply centers evenly distributed at the circle's center. If that were the case, more games would end with 5-, 6-, or even 7-way draws, as players would be able to protect their centers around the edges while dipping their toes into the center without risking their home dots.  

You can try this thought experiment yourself, by assigning supply centers to territories that are currently not centers. 

As it is, Tyrolia is not a supply center. Nor is Silesia. 

Instead, with the exception of Spain, neutral supply centers are positioned adjacent to but not usually directly on common stalemate lines. This means that for a stalemate line to be properly established, a player must put his neutral supply centers at risk. More commonly, a player will aim to create a mini-pseudo-stalemate line--blocking a neighbor's attack--which puts his owned centers at risk from other neighbors.

This simple imbalance innate to the Diplomacy board texture keeps players jostling for position from game start to game end. 

Furthermore, so long as Turkey or England are in the game, there are players in control of units that are _behind_ common stalemate lines. The potential for imbalances to be exploited remains. Whilst a volatile or savvy Turkey or England remain in the game, a stalemate position cannot be established. Nor should, from a Turkish or English strategic perspective, this be allowed. 

_For a deeper statistical study of relative imbalances relating to solo victories, see this article, ['The Statistician: Solo Victories'](http://uk.diplom.org/pouch/Zine/F2007R/Burton/statistician3.htm) by Josh Burton._


## Why Italy and France Don't Fight

Given the strategic importance of MAO, Spa, and WES to endgame stalemate lines, it may seem to reason that Italy and France could and should fight, and that this fight would produce profits for the winner.

In actual play, a positive result for either power is harder to achieve. 

I'm going to make short work of the obvious reasons which have been discussed before so as to move onto the not obvious reasons. 

Obvious: 

By not fighting, France and Italy can focus their attention elsewhere.

Other powers are likely to gain _more_ from a weakening or elimination of either Italy or France than Italy or France themselves.

It takes a long time to win this fight. 

Not Obvious: 

1 Italy and France are not really neighbors.

2 Moving away from neutral supply centers. 

3 How many units it takes to win this fight.


### Italy and France are Not Really Neighbors

Switzerland's wall and Piedmont's gate already keep Italy and France separated by land. Now, let's examine their proximity by boat. The Tyrennian Sea, the Gulf of Lyon, and the Western Med create an ocean of distance to cross. 

Italy cannot steal a center from France. Nor can France steal one from Italy. (Almost all other neighbors can steal centers given their proximity.) Even something like F MAO - WES in Fall 1901 setting up a convoy to NaF in Spring 1902 is hardly a surprise attack. And, by contrast to say an English move of F NTH - SKA in Fall 1901, where England can arrange plans with either Russia or Germany, it is clear what F MAO - WES (and a Winter 1901 build of F Mar) intends.

In MNDC2020 Game 01, France started as described above and even successfully convoyed to Tuscany in Fall 1902, leap-frogging the Italian army in Piedmont. Frankly, while tactically successful, France only had a single army in the north (Burgundy) and this approach left France open to an attack from Germany. (Had this been a Western Triple, France might have been okay.) In that game, it was only by helping Austria into Venice so that Austria could from Venice support French A Tus - Rom that France was able to in Winter 1903 build an army in Brest (having already lost Paris) to try to hold on. 

### Moving away from Neutral Supply Centers

Having earlier discussed the gravitational pull of neutral supply centers, we gain another theoretical insight about why France moving on Italy is suboptimal. 

Let's suppose France owns Belgium. We know this only occurs in about a quarter of games come Winter 1901, but it is not uncommon for France to own Belgium at some point in 1901-1904, during which time she might consider moving on Italy. 

As soon as units move away from the protection of Belgium, it will be harder to hold it. And once it falls, where do you think either of its new owners--England or Germany--are moving next? If England has eyes on France, moving against Italy immediately makes it difficult to hold MAO. If Germany comes a knockin', Burgundy is in trouble. 

From Italy's point of view, a move on France may require it to move out of ION, an enticing landing zone for either an Austrian or, more likely, a Turkish fleet. If Italy owns Greece as a fifth center, or perhaps Trieste in an AI Modern Borders setup, he must rely on his ally to protect it while committing units westward. 

### It Takes A Large Force to Win This Fight

Even with a French jump into WES or an Italian into GoL or Pie, considerable forces are needed to swiftly win this fight. It is arguably one of the _slowest_ fights on the board. 

If left alone, France or Italy could win this fight, but will the unlikley victor be making gains faster than other parts of the board? 

From France's perspective, it usually takes three fleets to break Italy's two-fleet mix (if Italy is only on 4 centers). France would probably need to be on five or six centers to think about even trying this. 

From Italy's perspective, it will also take three fleets to break either into MAO, Spa, or Mar. (Or two fleets and an army, but even that isn't a guarantee.)

Oftentimes, because of the drawn-out affair, other powers will be able to lend a hand, but that hand is more likely to tax Italy or France for the help than play second-fiddle to the invasion.

## Supply Center and Unit Density

To be written. 

Key points: 

There are 75 territories, of which 34 are supply centers. 

It takes 2 units to dislodge 1. As most players begin the game with only 3 units, it takes a majority of his units to dislodge another player's single unit.
