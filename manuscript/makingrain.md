# How to Make it Rain (TO BE WRITTEN)

This chapter is about predicting your opponent's every move. About seeing what they will do before they even know they will do it themselves. About dominating tactically through a deep understanding of psychology and decision-making under uncertainty.

In other words, this chapter is about making it rain.

## Shamans

How do you make the rains come like the ancient shamans?

## Gains and Losses

Whether Germany or France or England claims Belgium in 1901 (or none at all) matters, but no matter what there will only be a change of +1 to whichever power claims it. 

Once all neutrals are claimed, any supply center gained is a supply center lost to another power. The dots must now "change hands". 

So, if the adage is true that we fear losses more than we like gains, it is doubly true in Diplomacy, because our loss is our neighbor's gain. 

ESPECIALLY true for home centers, which act as hatcheries, where new armies and fleets are molded for the battlefield.
