# A Sailor's Story

Follows an English fleet in MNDC2020 Game 01, to demonstrate how a unit moves, and also how with territory adjacency and unit (army/fleet) density, it isn't easy to travel so far. 

The exception in that game is the English army in Ukraine. 

Compare with StarCraft, where a seige tank tracks number of kills. Gives each unit a story. Similar to Yu-kai and the emotions of his chess pieces.
