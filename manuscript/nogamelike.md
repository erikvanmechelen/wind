## Why There is Still No Game like Diplomacy (350w)

Richard Sharp said it well when he remarked that to win in Diplomacy you have to be a complete cad. I for one had to look up the definition: A man who behaves dishonorably, especially toward women. 

I never knew or spoke with Sharp, so I won’t ever know the tone or meaning of this, nor do I necessarily support playing precisely in this way, but I more or less see his point. 

(If someone answers your simple question of ‘Shall we bounce in the Black?’ with as wishy-washy an answer as the preceding paragraph, beware!) 

Even half a decade after Sharp wrote those words, dishonorable-behaving men (and women) remain among us—in fact our hearts may be split!—as does thank the Almighty, the great hobby of Diplomacy. 

Even if all of us who adore, even love, the game as we do—traveling hundreds of miles per year in horse-drawn wagons to play in face-to-face tournaments--decided to quit today, a young gamer would find it buried in the sand, and as in Jumanji unleash its dark but necessary chaos back into the world. 

If for no other reason, we should not forget how to lie nor how to deceive convincingly, lest the boundary between truth and lies dissolve completely as the boundary between chivalry and chauvinism. 

I’ve said the above to underscore my leading explanation for why Diplomacy persists when the zeitgeist says it should not: While other games do include amoral or even immoral behavior, those games excuse players for it; Diplomacy does not hide from its nature, and instead says, “You are a human playing with and against other humans: Use what tools you have, as they will use tools against you.” 

The decision to forgive trespasses or to take revenge is up to each individual, and this decision is hardly the most important part of the game. 

(There are aspects of each of us, as individuals, and collectively, as a human family, which are undeniable, no matter how much we might intellectually rebel against them. When we are out of balance, we hunger for those aspects which bring harmony to life, we have a need to experience what some may call the vices. If anything, to my way of thinking, Diplomacy is one of the most productive environments to live in those vices for a time, if only so as not to build up debts that come due at an unexpected and unfortunate moment in your actual day-to-day life.)

(The relationship you have with yourself is arguably the most important of all, and even the sharpest and most introspective among us cannot completely know ourselves. If we are honest, we can grasp a kind of fact which says we are wilfully blind to part of ourselves, just to go on living. But insofar as I do understand a surface-level portion of myself, this understanding has not only led me to play Diplomacy regularly, but also to exercise, to read, to write books like these, to endeavor to write novels, to find work in a small gamification company as an enthusiastic community manager, and to invest in several key relationships from family members to artists and designers and creators in the Minneapolis-St. Paul neighborhoods.) 

(You can probably guess why I suspect there is no game—yet—like Diplomacy, but for the purposes of keeping you on edge as to whether I’ll walk into Trieste, I’ll reserve a fuller discussion till later.)
