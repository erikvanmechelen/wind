# How You Think > What You Think

![Let's be honest, the board you play on matters](/resources/stolafboard.png)

After a recent game a fellow member of the Minnesota Diplomacy Club asked me, "So Erik, have you changed your mind about England playing F Lon - ENG in Spring 1901 as a standard?"

The late Clayton Christiansen once [refused to tell Intel what they should do](https://hbr.org/2010/07/how-will-you-measure-your-life), instead insisting on sharing an example outside their industry to illustrate the concept, and only then asking them if they saw anything new to do in their own business. 

One of my favorite writers, Christopher Hitchens, echoes in *Letters to a Young Contrarian* that it is far more important how ones thinks than what one thinks. The process at which one arrives at conclusions should allow for variation over time, including reversals, in the specific content (or output) of one's thinking. 

This holds true for Diplomacy. 

Because it is not so easy to describe the kind of game Diplomacy is, we risk and do succeed in hamstringing ourselves by answering an easier question. 

For example, we might instead answer the question, What does it take to win at Diplomacy? 

You start to think about your most recent game...and you remember a viscious stab (wonderfully orchestrated) by your erstwhile ally. You conclude: "A modicum of timely perfidy!"

Sure, *some* deception and outright lies may very likely be required to consistently succeed at Diplomacy, but we have skipped over the question of what kind of game Diplomacy is, and by simply suggesting a new player remember to deceive his opponents on occasion, we really don't offer much guidance at all. This new player will have to work backwards to ask himself what sort of game he is playing, and build to his own conclusions. 

Here is a concrete example. If anything, you might have steered him wrong from the outset: Perhaps as France he declines to share his intentions to move on Burgundy and the German player, unsure of why France seemed so suspicious in Spring 1901 negotiations, sends his Munich army to bounce. Now France may believe he has lied, been caught, and may head into Fall 1901 negotiations somewhat sheepishly, all the while having no influence on the fate of Belgium in 1901. This, of course, could have entirely been avoided. 

Before moving on, perhaps you'd like to know what I think about the English Channel. I might respond, Is the English Channel the proper name for that body of water? Jokes aside, you already know I'm not going to answer many questions phrased in such a way. If you had asked, "*How* do you think about the English Channel?", then I might have ventured a reply.
