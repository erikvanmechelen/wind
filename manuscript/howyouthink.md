# How You Think > What You Think

After a face-to-face game in 2019 a fellow member of the Minnesota Diplomacy Club asked me, "So Erik, have you changed your mind about England playing F Lon - ENG in Spring 1901 as a standard?"

How you think is more important than what you think. 

Generally I like F Lon - Eng because it is: a) likely to succeed; b) does not rule out collaboration with France; c) is generally pro-German and pro-Russian (maybe one of them will buy you a drink at this point); d) difficult to dislodge in the early game; and e) *insert your own reasons here*...

However, to make such a move in Spring 1901, I would prefer certain conditions, some of which I would have influenced diplomatically. Obviously, the first is that France is likely to play F Bre - MAO and *not* F Bre - Lon. Bouncing there in Spring 1901 is bad for both. We know that F Bre - MAO is quite standard, probably played in more than 75% of French openings. The second preferred condition is that I can smooth things over with France after moving to ENG (if I did so unexpectedly). Third, that the move to ENG creates a positive image from at least Germany's or Russia's perspective, preferably both. 

These conditions might be influenced in advance of the move, but/and they should be sold as such after your fleet successfully reaches the English Channel. In other words, Germany should be reminded of ways F ENG is useful to him, and Russia should be reminded that he need not be concerned of F NWG - BAR (as, presumably, with your second fleet you opened F Edi - NTH).

Now, of course, there are conditions which disallow me to vote for F Lon - ENG. Perhaps the simplest is if I receive persuasive intel that the Bear is opening F Mos - Stp, in which case I'm left little option save F Edi - NWG and F Lon - NTH in order to support myself into Nwy for the Winter 1901 build.

This is an example of how I think about a specific issue: What to do with F Lon in Spring 1901. 

Noting how your opponents think--including their views on scoring systems, strategy, fair play, and not discounting subconscious bias--and how those individuals are thinking (and feeling) in this particular game, is a useful skill to bring on board as well. More on this as we venture forth into the various issues of negotiation in this great game of Diplomacy.
