# Acknowledgments

With everything any of us do, we are likely to be standing on the shoulders of giants. 

This hobby has numerous legends. 

I don't know how many of the following people are legends nor is it up to me to decide, but they've helped me in small and large ways to produce this resource or otherwise provide encouragement at key moments, especially Allan B. Calhamer, Chris Martin, Andrew Goff, Richard Sharp, David Hood, Stephen Agar, Mark Berch, Dave Maletsky, Brandon Fogel, Zachary Moore, Jacob Langenfeld.

You might be surprised to learn that Calhamer wrote a fair amount on Diplomacy, and that he was not opposed to off-board tricks, nor altogether put off [when an opponent hid his carefully-planned orders at the bottom of a wastebasket](http://www.dipwiki.com/index.php?title=Military_Intelligence) in the defense laboratory where they played Diplomacy in their down time. 

> When the time came to read these moves, however, I couldnâ€™t find them. A lengthy search failed to produce them. It seems Turkey and A.-H. had quietly taken them. As we were playing in a laboratory engaged in defense work (strictly on our own time - it was about 10:30 p.m.), there were padlocked waste baskets around, intended "for classified waste only". My orders to my armies and fleets were at the bottom of one of these baskets.

> As I had not gotten orders through to my units, they stood in place instead of moving. Fortunately, the interception of these orders ("by an Austrian spy") had not been coordinated with an attack on my positions. I was able to carry out my shift to the east side of the Adriatic on the following move. I swept through the disorganized Balkan area and had acquired 13 units, with a demonstrable win of three more by the end of the game.

As can be discerned, he was also not incapable of soloing with Austria.

It is also fun to see the beginning of Austrian-Italian theory in early articles like ['On Strengthening the Hand of Austria-Hungary'](http://www.dipwiki.com/index.php?title=On_Strengthening_the_hand_of_Austria-Hungary), describing possible AI combinations that have begun standard theory today.

And of course this gem, in ['The Tactics of Diplomacy'](http://www.dipwiki.com/index.php?title=The_Tactics_of_Diplomac) originally written in 1961.
