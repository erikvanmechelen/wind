## Let him have revenge...or he'll take his revenge later. 

(Commonly understood among top heads-up online poker players...once your opponent is on monkey tilt, you must allow him to play a high-variance style...he may even win back a good chunk of his money, but if you try to protect your winnings by limping or min-raising the button and folding to his preflop three-bets, you will lose your customer. The customer is always right, especially if he is a monkey on a tilted shopping spree.)

If the opponent wants revenge, let him FEEL like he's had his revenge. Otherwise, not yet satisfied, he will seek it indefinitely. 

This is a problem I've noticed among some players in our club, although only because I first noticed seeds of it within my own psyche. You can bet I was confused to find it. In a situation where I should have been comfortable with a clearly mutually beneficial alliance, why was I stand-offish? Why wasn't I seeking easy gains? 

Where some describe this as an ongoing narrative--so and so likes to attack so and so, or that's what that player does--my view is that such a "narrative" usually disguises some other deeper unresolved mechanic or model within a player's mind.

Certainly there are what might be called metagame elements which may enter a game. If you know a player's tendencies, it would be foolish to ignore those, however oversimplifying your model of an opponent might work against you. Better to constantly refresh your models as new information comes in.
