# Scoring Systems

Since the seven versions of the rulebook are either contradictory or ambiguous about how to value draws and wins, several scoring systems have emerged in online, club, and tournaments scenes. You might peruse [this list of 50+ scoring systems](http://www.world-diplomacy-database.com/php/scoring/scoring.php) to see how much experimentation the hobby has tried.  

The chosen scoring system suggests a kind of value system, a kind of preference, or set of preferences, a particular person or group has toward how the game of Diplomacy ought to be played.

Once you know what style of game you like to play--or perhaps, which style suits your own strengths--you might selfishly find yourself preferring a certain system.  

## Draw-Size Scoring (Winner Take All)

I'm actually reasonably partial to draw-based scoring. If no-one actually won the game (18 centers), then it is a draw shared equally. 

## Sum of Squares

Sum of Squares works quite well because it does reward dominance, though it doesn't reward survival well and in some cases incentivizes small powers to work with dominant powers to eliminate other small powers. 

This being said, my wife quipped, "Well, no one should be giving out 8th-place trophies anyway." 

## My Preferred, for a Club League System

Leading up to 2020, the Minnesota Diplomacy Club discussed Recruitment & Retention as important priorities for the 2020 season. We had grown to 30 players and wanted to continue growing and also have players be excited enough to return for 3+ games each season.

After studying Janus, developed in Chicago, I proposed we either shift to Janus for 2020, or as a compromise, trial it alongside Sum of Squares--in that case we would have two sets of standings.

My preference was to play with one scoring system, whichever we felt best created the kind of game we want to have and which would also foster the club environment for recruitment and retention.

For what it's worth, and before I heard of Janus, my personal preference was (and is) for a system which emphasizes longer and more dynamic games (perhaps best would be a Top Board Format, single winner per game). However in reality we don't have time to play 8-10-hour games in our club. Since we are not trying to please me, but rather to create a club-based league system that is fun for new and returning players, Janus deserved our immediate consideration with clear advantages over Sum-of-Squares.

Janus's survival bonus meaningfully rewards survival without sacrificing incentives for dominant board tops, while also cleverly incentivizing balance of power. We can proceed without a newbie protection rule but also reward newer or less experienced players with decent 3rd- or 4th-place results. Insofar as players care about standings (as a pull to return), a few mediocre games keeps you in the running. Finally, Janus is easy to calculate on the fly in-game. 

In the first game of the year, [MNDC2020 Game 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqXoj-sDBVA&feature=youtu.be)--and [here's the Backstabbr sandbox](https://www.backstabbr.com/sandbox/MNDC2020-01/4537400859033600) I believe that under Janus, Turkey possibly makes a move in 1906 against Austria, which relieves pressure on Germany, which allows Germany to hold his own against England. Additionally, Germany / Italy don't dump centers at the 11th hour. (There is less incentive to dump centers to punish others.) In my theoretical example, Austria holds on for a modest Board Top of 8 centers, though four powers in our game were in contention starting in 1905-1908 leaving the outcome quite uncertain. The result in terms of scoring? See Game 5 of the following analysis.

[Analysis of Sum of Squares versus Janus for MNDC2020 Game 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11fsYqKguS2fy-oCHC7b3-Qj6X69IQ0KdT9JJ_7kNEJk/edit?usp=sharing). (A working understanding of Janus--see the article by Brandon Fogel.)

In the analysis I ran of MNDC2020 Game 1, there are 5 possible games: 

Game 1 is the actual result of our MNDC2020 Game 1. 

Game 2 is a shared board top (AE).

Game 3 has Germany taking France's last center.

Game 4 is a shared board top (AE) with Germany taking France's last center.

Game 5 is a theoretical result based on Janus incentives (instead of SoS).

For further possible evidence as to how players reacted to SoS incentives in the actual game, refer to [this Sandbox on Backstabbr](https://www.backstabbr.com/sandbox/MNDC2020-01/4537400859033600) or the actual game footage on YouTube in 1906, 1907, and 1908. Based on our time cutoff, this game was probably going to finish in 1908, certainly no later than 1909.

(Here's [the actual conversation where Germany decides to give centers to England](https://youtu.be/hMAdbfGzFis?t=363) starting in Spring 1907.)

Keep in mind that in the last season of MNDC2020 Game 1, Fall 1908, Zach as Austria misordered; had Zach ordered correctly he would have regained Sevastopol from me (England), and then he and I would have shared the Board Top. In a shared Board Top under Janus, there are no transfers of shares of the 60-point Survival Pool, which flattens the result (the Balance of Power incentive competes against the Board Top incentive). 

Hopefully this elongated explanation and analysis gives you some actual data and argument to consider which scoring system you implement in your own games. 

Remember, how you value a board game experience and how you view the game of Diplomacy will likely influence that decision. Give those two questions a think first, then decide! You can't go too horribly wrong one way or another. 

_In the Minnesota Diplomacy Club, the best three results and the average of remaining scores puts you in contention for a top-7 Top Board, Championship game for the title 'Best Diplomacy Player in Minnesota, while the best overall score from the season earns you the title 'Player of the Year' and poll position for the Paris Method great power selection in the Championship._
