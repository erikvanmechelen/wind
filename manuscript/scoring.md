## My Preferred, for a Club League System

We previously discussed Recruitment & Retention as important priorities for MNDC this year. 

After studying Janus, developed in Chicago, I want to propose we either shift to Janus for 2020, or as a compromise, trial it alongside SoS--in that case we would have 2 sets of standings.
My preference is to play with one scoring system, whichever we feel best creates the kind of game we want to have and which also fosters the club environment for recruitment & retention.

For what it's worth, and before I heard of Janus, my personal preference is for a system which emphasizes longer and more dynamic games (perhaps best would be a Top Board Format, single winner per game). However in reality we don't have time to play 8-10-hour games. Since we are not trying to please me, but rather to create a club-based league system that is fun for new and returning players, Janus deserves our immediate consideration with clear advantages over Sum-of-Squares.

Here's Why:
Janus's survival bonus meaningfully rewards survival without sacrificing incentives for dominant board tops, while also cleverly incentivizing balance of power. We can proceed without a newbie protection rule but also reward newer or less experienced players with decent 3rd- or 4th-place results. Insofar as players care about standings (as a pull to return), a few mediocre games keeps you in the running. Finally, Janus is easy to calculate on the fly in-game. 

In our most recent game, MNDC2020 Game 1, I believe that under Janus, Turkey possibly makes a move in 1906 against Austria, which relieves pressure on Germany, which allows Germany to hold his own against England. Additionally, Germany / Italy don't dump centers at the 11th hour. (There is less incentive to dump centers to punish others.) In my theoretical example, Austria holds on for a modest Board Top of 8 centers, though four powers in our game were in contention starting in 1905-1908 leaving the outcome quite uncertain. The result in terms of scoring? See Game 5 of the following analysis.

Here's an analysis I ran of MNDC2020 Game 1, which shows 5 possible games: 
Game 1 is the actual result of our MNDC2020 Game 1. Game 2 is a shared board top (AE).Game 3 has Germany taking France's last center.Game 4 is a shared board top (AE) with Germany taking France's last center.Game 5 is a theoretical result based on Janus incentives (instead of SoS).For further possible evidence as to how players reacted to SoS incentives in the actual game, refer to this Sandbox on Backstabbr or the actual game footage on YouTube in 1906, 1907, and 1908. Based on our time cutoff, this game was probably going to finish in 1908, certainly no later than 1909.

(Here's the actual conversation where Germany decides to give centers to England starting in Spring 1907...https://youtu.be/hMAdbfGzFis?t=363.)
Keep in mind that in the last season of MNDC2020 Game 1, Fall 1908, Zach as Austria misordered; had Zach ordered correctly he would have regained Sevastopol from me (England), and then he and I would have shared the Board Top. In a shared Board Top under Janus, there are no transfers of shares of the 60-point Survival Pool, which flattens the result (the Balance of Power incentive competes against the Board Top incentive). 

All thoughts / discussion very welcome! 

Perhaps we can convene in early Feb to make a decision? 

Thanks,
