# Environment

You've decided to join a game of Diplomacy. But where exactly are you taking your talents? Are you logging into Backstabbr, suiting up for your local gaming cafe, or packing a suitcase for an international tournament? 

Choosing where to play Diplomay and with whom is an important decision. 

Perhaps the first decision is whether to play online or face to face. (I recommend both.)

Each has distinct advantages and disadvantages. The games will play differently.

For my money, and more importantly, invest of time and attention, face to face is aces. It is both the most immersive and also carries the advantage of being time-bound...even if a game goes six hours, I will not have to correspond with players across days and weeks of time nor live with constant anxiety of missing an order due date or forgetting to build while on vacation away from my computer. The result after those six hours is the result, and I can live with a draw, a sweet victory, or the numerous blunders that led to my defeat.  

For reasons not clear to me, in the only other long-form book on Diplomacy, [_The Game of Diplomacy_](https://diplomacy-archive.com/god), Richard Sharp describes his distaste for face-to-face play. I personally find it the most challenging, engaging, and immersive form of the game. 

But wait!, you contend, Surely gathering seven players is no easy feat! In fact, because it isn't easy, you convince yourself, it must be...impossible!

You would be surprised--I was!--how quickly a game can be arranged...and pretty soon you might even have club as we did in high school--imagine our teacher's surprise when she would intercept our passed notes during class!--or as we do now, a decade and a half later, in Minnesota! (Chicago's Windy City Weasels have a similar story, becoming a premier environment for face-to-face play across all of the United States these past 15+ years...and it all started with a casual pub game.)

Club game action is great, but face-to-face tournament play is arguably the crowning environment to test your Diplomacy skills. At a tournament, players not only get to compete across multiple games but also have the downtime between games to get to know each other and build comraderie that lasts a lifetime. 

One version of online play I am (or might become) partial to is a fast-paced, time-bound affair. However to my eyes, the infrastructure isn't quite there yet to support it. Perhaps the Backstabbr framework could be adapted to my preferred vision. In [episode 57 of the Diplomacy Games podcast](https://diplomacygames.com/interview-with-jon-from-backstabbr/) hosted by Amby and Kaner, Jon--one of Backstabbr's developers--mentioned the possibility of opening up their adjudication API so that others might continue to innovate in the online Diplomacy world. 

For the sake of completion, I will cover both online and live play. 

In addition, I will discuss what kinds of players are most enjoyable to play with. From what I've observed, creating a culture where players want to return to play Diplomacy is tricky, but definitely possible, and not least because Diplomacy is such a great game. (Imagine, for a moment, how difficult it is to get a given person--including yourself--to take up _any_ habit, let alone an entire hobby.)

In the Minnesota Diplomacy scene, we have learned much from one partial season in 2018 (6 games) and one complete season (19 games including a Championship game in 2019). A high priority is keeping the games consistently competitive and enjoyable for most if not all players. I will close this chapter with suggestions when forming your own group or club, and carry on to a discussion of Scoring Systems which is a crucial ingredient of any Diplomacy game, website, club, or tournament. 

I would be remiss to leave out one more way to play: If you want to go old-school, you could send letters in the mail as press between players and each season send orders to a gamemaster who, after adjudicating the moves, sends out a letter to each player with the results. To save time, you might send adjustments in conditionally (build A Lon if I build at all). Play-by-mail was how the hobby got started in earnest before transitioning online. Email and the gamemaster's ability to publish zines made it easier for players to communicate and enjoy the great game of Diplomacy. 


## Playing Online

When I was 16 I had already founded a club at Cypress Creek High School in Houston, Texas, but over the summer I wanted to keep our games going. I couldn't convince everyone to jump on games adjudicated by the DPJudge, but I did find other games to join. I remember playing in 20-odd games the summer between sophomore and junior year. 

That was in the early 2000s, and since the online scene has expanded considerably, with key offerings from webdiplomacy.net, vdiplomacy.com, and playdiplomacy.com. The Nexus, which runs its games on Backstabbr, is an up-and-coming tournament space run on a Discord server. 

One of Facebook's early developers was a big Diplomacy fan and created a Facebook app, though it is no longer supported. 

For mobile, there are two Android versions, Conspiracy and Diplicity. 

### Challenges Playing Online

When you navigate to webdiplomacy.net you will almost immediately find a section discussing their reliability rating: 

"The first is our “Reliability Rating” (RR); this ranking is determined based on how often you fail to enter moves in a turn (NMR/No Moves Received) or leave a game before it’s conclusion (CD/Civil Disorder). Most tournaments, special rules games, or high stakes games have RR restrictions; meaning if you leave games often or irresponsibly forget to enter moves frequently you may find it hard to join competitive games."

This rating is appropriate as it helps GMs determine if certain players might be entered into a game. 

Backstabbr has a similar rating system, showing how often a certain player has missed orders.

In my first three games on Conspiracy, all were riddled with missed orders, misorders, and a lack of communication between players. Tyler Waaler, who cofounded Nexus Diplomacy, spoke with the founders about their player data and found that they had also noticed this general trend. It remains to be seen if anything can be done to amend it. As is, brand new players to Diplomacy who happen to land on Conspiracy will likely be treated to a subpar game which lacks at least one key ingredient to a fun game of Diplomacy, negotiation between players. 

### Anonymous Players

Some online games can be played using aliases or be played under anonymous conditions.

This is done so that players cannot communicate outside the game, or to make the play more dynamic amongst a small group, or for other reasons related to the taste of participants. 

For me, anonymity is a bug, not a feature. While I can appreciate the added layer of figuring out who is who, I simply like interacting with humans more than deciphering anonymous text messages. 

### Bots

And what about AI and bots? Surely they could help us by filling abandoned spaces or missed orders. 

Or we might soon be playing against them. I don't understand enough about coding syntax to create such a bot myself (alone), but I could take a shot at developing the logic behind a decision. I would then test this by putting that logic up against human gunboat players. Here are a few parameters I might consider with varying weights:

Gaining supply centers
Protecting against loss of supply centers
Supporting and support-cutting
Influencing moves / bluffs / feints
Moves to gain high-leverage territories (Black Sea, North Sea)

Wait, you're thinking, couldn't this already be done? Hasn't it?

It has. Here's [Rise of the Bots, Episode 52 of the Diplomacy Games Podcast](https://diplomacygames.com/rise-of-the-bots/) with Amby and Kaner, where they discuss supervised learning and reinforced learning. So far this work has only been done on gunboat games sans negotiation.

I remember the glory days of online poker, which I in part got to participate in, which are behind us. Even during my peak, there were bots. But now, sites have to work hard to discover them and assure human players they are competing against humans, not bots. 

I think it will take a little time yet for bots to figure out how to participate in a press-based online game, and a little longer yet to compete in face-to-face games. Just as MIT hopes its soccer robots will compete against the 2050 World Cup winners, maybe it will take as long to develop AI strong enough to carry on fast-paced verbal negotiations with six players and still come out on top of a Diplomacy contest.

One great part about Diplomacy is that even if I reason that you are most likely lying about something, there remains a great amount of uncertainty toward your actual move set unless we have dissected one by one what each of your units will be doing, a pattern which is not often the norm in actual play because of how much information it gives up to your opponents (even if they are allies...perhaps especially if they are, so as to avoid a critical stab).

A lie-detecting bot could figure out that I was lying about something, and proceed to ask me hard questions about my intentions or even my specific ideal moves, but if I'm not incentivized to talk about those things I can opt to deflect the questions or refuse to talk. As in any negotiation, continuing to talk about something the other party isn't interested in talking about usually doesn't get you very far. To my way of thinking, an AI will have to be as dexterous as a human, in terms of communication ability, to effectively dance, else it will be at a disadvantage in the information game. Maybe, though I cannot easily imagine it, the AI will usurp the human in its ability to communicate with and manipulate humans. At that point the AIs will stop reading this book, moving onto tomes about Diplomacy authored by fellow AIs. 


## Playing Face to Face

Every player is a universe only partially visible. Any individual cannot even really know himself. 

I used to respond, when player's asked what I would have done had they raised me on the river, with "I don't know, you didn't do it." The same idea holds in Diplomacy. What would I have said or done had you moved to Galicia in Spring 1901, violating our agreement? I don't know, you didn't do it. 

Judging a player's response, in advance, is valuable information indeed. If I know as Austria you are likely to get over my moving to Galicia as Russia, then there is justification strategically to arrange the DMZ and promptly violate it. Then I am in Galicia. In this case I have a valuable territory, a forgiving Austrian with whom I might still be able to work, leverage on Rumania, flexibility in the Black Sea, and bargaining chips with neighbors (who may like to see Austria pegged down a notch).

If the reverse is true--an Austrian who will act vengefully over the broken DMZ--I may and probably would approach this differently. 

Of course, a Russian early game is just fine without occupying Galicia in Spring 1901. So is this really the first thing that you and Austria should discuss? 

This is a snippet of what I might be thinking in approaching a conversation--as Russia--with a _single_ opposing Austrian player. Of course, I haven't even gone into a discussion of how what other information I have from around the board and other players might adjust how I approach that conversation with Austria. 

Once in the conversation, I will need to listen, make decisions about where to take the conversation, respond effectively, disguise my intentions where necessary, ask questions, encourage, influence, and otherwise manage my time so I can speak with other players around the board. 

There is simply too much information passing between players that you are not privy too (outside your own conversation) to make perfectly informed decisions at every stage of the negotiation process, or, indeed, once it is time to write your orders. 

This challenge is part of what makes Diplomacy such an interesting game. Every player must develop a meta-layer of strategy for how they will approach their negotiations, in general, so as to gather as much information as possible and influence their opponents as much as possible. The face to face game is truly a beautiful simulator of realpolitik. Or, in the terminology of John J. Mearsheimer's [The Tragedy of Great Power Politics](https://amzn.to/2FxMVcu), a study of offensive realism. 

### Club Games

Finding a local club is a great way to get into a regular habit of Diplomacy. You not only will most likely get a quality game, but also the chance to create relationships with people who love Diplomacy as much as you do, and who won't get over sentimental about your successful backstab--it's part of the game! 

In Minnesota, we are soon to adopt the Janus scoring system, which improves upon the popular Sum of Squares system by incentivizing board tops, dominance, balance of power, and survival, all in tension with tradeoffs.

We believe this will enhance the experience for both new players and returning players alike.

### Tournaments

So far, I've only played in one tournament--the 2019 WeaselMoot XIII in Chicago--where I placed 5th, but I intend to play in upcoming World Diplomacy Championships at Carnage in Vermont (2020) and Bangkok, Thailand (2021).

My first tournament showed me how much more I had to learn about the face-to-face game and how varied the types of personalities and people are that play Diplomacy. It was an unforgettable experience that got me excited about playing more, investing more in the MN Diplomacy Club, and continuing to write my thoughts on the game in articles and eventually, this book.

## Where I Would Play First

If given the choice, I'd recommend starting with a face-to-face game. It's how so many of the best known players started, and I have a hunch it was that first good experience--win or lose--that made each of them understand Diplomacy's merits and lit the kindling of desire for more. 

In a face-to-face game, where all seven players have driven or wagoned or flown to a venue, you can bet that you will have the full or near-full attention of each competitor. This is a necessary, though not sufficient condition for deeply immersive and well-played game. 

Here's one more ingredient: Find a game with experienced players. If you are new, I recommend you try to be the only new player in a game of experienced players. This may seem counter-intuitive, but the cultural understanding that the remaining six players might offer you will outweigh the alternative, fumbling through the fundamentals with six other newbies.
