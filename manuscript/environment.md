You've decided to join a game of Diplomacy. But where exactly are you taking your talents? Are you logging into Backstabbr, suiting up for your local gaming caf√©, or packing a suitcase for an international tournament? 

(Since the novel coronavirus spread across Earth in late 2019 and early 2020, face-to-face games and tournaments are in shorter supply, but hybrid and fully online experiences have thrived.)

Choosing where to play Diplomacy and with whom is an important decision. 

Perhaps the first decision is whether to play online, hybrid, or face to face. I recommend all three. Diplomacy is fun and instructive across its many guises and flavors.

Each has distinct advantages and disadvantages. The games will play differently.

I much prefer face-to-face. Richard Sharp prefered play-by-mail. You may prefer hybrid or online.

Why face-to-face? It is both the most immersive and also carries the advantage of being time-bound. The game will usually end in well under a single rotation of the Earth. After which we players can reflect on the game, analyze it, joke over blunders, and otherwise commiserate and enjoy hanging out with people who appreciate the game. 

In the only other long-form book on Diplomacy, [_The Game of Diplomacy_](https://diplomacy-archive.com/god), Richard Sharp describes his distaste for face-to-face play. He prefers postal for more intricate strategies and detailed tactics to play out with more precision. It appears to me that online today plays similar to postal, however there are key differences: the time limits per round (much shorter online) and the amount of press which may be sent (unlimited with today's internet technologies).

Sure, it's not easy to get exactly 7 players for a game. But arranging a game is far from impossible.

You would be surprised--I was!--how quickly a game can be arranged...and pretty soon you might even have club as we did in high school--imagine our teacher's surprise when she would intercept our passed notes during class!--or as we do now, a decade and a half later, in Minnesota! (Chicago's Windy City Weasels have a similar story, becoming a premier environment for face-to-face play across all of the United States these past 15+ years...and it all started with a casual pub game.) Clubs have popped into and out of existence throughout the planet since Diplomacy's inception. Lately, there seems to be an uptick. Exciting times.

Club game action is great, but face-to-face tournament play is arguably the crowning environment to test your Diplomacy skills. At a tournament, players not only get to compete across multiple games but also have the downtime between games to get to know each other and build comraderie that lasts a lifetime. 

One version of online play I am (or might become) partial to is a fast-paced, time-bound affair. However to my eyes, the infrastructure isn't quite there yet to support it. Perhaps the Backstabbr framework could be adapted to my preferred vision. In [episode 57 of the Diplomacy Games podcast](https://diplomacygames.com/interview-with-jon-from-backstabbr/) hosted by Amby and Kaner, Jon--one of Backstabbr's developers--mentioned the possibility of opening up their adjudication API so that others might continue to innovate in the online Diplomacy world. 

*Edit: In early 2020, as it became clear that COVID-19 would be keeping many of us inside our homes, the MN Diplomacy Club put on one of, if not the first, livestreamed hybrid game, using Backstabbr for adjudication and phone calls for negotiation between players. I expect there will be continued innovation as previously face-to-face tournaments transition to keep us safe while also playing a game we love.*

For the sake of completion, in this book I will cover online, hybrid, and live play. See these chapters toward the book's second half.

In addition, I will discuss what kinds of players are most enjoyable to play with. From what I've observed, creating a culture where players want to return to play Diplomacy is tricky, but definitely possible, and not least because Diplomacy is such a great game. (Imagine, for a moment, how difficult it is to get a given person--including yourself--to take up _any_ habit, let alone an entire hobby.)

My dad used to tell me, "Erik, life is full of disappointments". A ground truth if you hold to Thomas Sowell's depiction of the simplified constrained vision of human nature. Maybe offering some words of welcome that also include this sentiment would benefit very new players who expect to win or have too much fun in their first game.

In the Minnesota Diplomacy scene, we have learned much from one partial season in 2018 (6 games) and one complete season (19 games including a Championship game in 2019) and an ongoing 2020 season. A high priority is keeping the games consistently competitive and enjoyable for most if not all players. Again, enjoyment is not necessarily tied to material success, not in life or Diplomacy.

I would be remiss to leave out one more way to play: If you want to go old-school, you could send letters in the mail as press between players and each season send orders to a gamemaster who, after adjudicating the moves, sends out a letter to each player with the results. To save time, you might send adjustments in conditionally (build A Lon if I build at all). Play-by-mail was how the hobby got started in earnest before transitioning online. Email and the gamemaster's ability to publish zines made it easier for players to communicate and enjoy the great game of Diplomacy.
