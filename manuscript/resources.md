If you're reading a digital version of this book, the following may serve you: 

Here is [PDF of the rulebook](https://www.wizards.com/avalonhill/rules/diplomacy.pdf) from the version of the game I own. 

[This page on WikiBooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Diplomacy/Rules) is useful too.

Brandon Fogel's discussion of [the Tribute Scoring System](https://github.com/erikvanmechelen/diplomacybook/blob/master/2019-07%20-%20Systems%20of%20Value%20in%20Diplomacy%20(Janus)%20v3%20(1).pdf) provides a brief history of scoring systems and advocates for the upcoming Janus approach. (Scoring system was previously called Janus.)

Here's a [Tribute Calculator](http://windycityweasels.org/tribute-scoring-system/).

If you're starting a club or local game, to keep new players organized and less overwhelmed, try handing out the [Diplomacy Games Journal - Austria Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1704088372), or [Germany Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1704300924) or [Italy Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1704232562).

To practice online, [Watch this video](https://youtu.be/mgWste5NwNY) on how to get started on [Conspiracy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.badfrog.conspiracy.app&hl=en_US) or open up a sandbox at [backstabbr.com](backstabbr.com).

Prefer to watch high-level players in action, look no further than [Chris Martin's full video recap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPlUuvIV7ws&list=PLbwng27eI0e3O9rIFcXp_Bvr97TNgAsQw) of the World Diplomacy Championships 2016. I'm waiting, and I think I'll be waiting for awhile, to see a better combination of reporting, commentary, and analysis by a World Diplomacy Champion on a top-shelf Diplomacy tournament Top Board.
