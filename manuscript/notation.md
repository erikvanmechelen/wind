# Notation

Diplomacy notation is easy to understand once you’ve learned it. I'll be using the following in this book: 

MOVE  
A Mar - Spa  (Army Marseilles Moves to Spain)  
F Ank - BLA  (Fleet Ankara Moves to Black Sea)  

SUPPORT  
A Par - Bur  
A Mar S Par - Bur (Army in Marseilles Supports Army Paris Moves to Burgundy)  

The order ‘A Par - Bur’ must also be written for the above Support order to be valid. 

CONVOY  
A Pic - Wal  
F ENG C Pic - Wal  (Fleet English Channel Convoys Army Picardy to Wales)   

The order ‘A Pic - Wal’ must also be written for the above Convoy order to be valid.  

HOLD  
A Mun H  (Army Munich Holds position)
