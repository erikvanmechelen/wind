# Endgame

Thank you so very much for going on this short ride with me through my general thoughts about Diplomacy. 

To find out what I really think and how I really play, you'll have to jump on a board with me. 

Bounce you soon!

If you got any value from this book, consider sharing it with a new Diplomacy player. Why not continue to bring more people of all origins and ambitions into the game? It's more fun as the games get tougher. The victories are sweeter, and the collaborative recap in the pub is that much more satisfying.
