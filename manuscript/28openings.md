The relationships you set up are more important than the tactical position. 



## Balkan Gambit (Austria)

A Vie - Tri/Gal/Bud  
A Bud - Ser  
F Tri - Alb  

A great chance for two builds, arguably necessary for Austria, except in situations where an AI is combining in the 'Modern Borders' concept to put Italy in Trieste.

The question is what to do with A Vie. If the Russian can be persuaded to do something else with A War besides A War - Gal, then Austria can hedge against A Ven - Tri with A Vie - Tri. If you feel secure, you can go for A Vie - Bud and have a say in the futures of the kind people of Rumania.

## Galician Gambit (Austria)

A Vie – Tri
A Bud – Gal
F Tri – Alb

Assuming a bounce in Galicia, this opening does allow the Austrian to support himself into Serbia with A Tri – Ser and A Bud S Tri – Ser. F Alb heads for Greece and a possible two-build Winter.

Of course, with the right diplomacy, A Bud (again assuming a bounce with Russian A War – Gal) could also affect Rumania’s fate or try again for Galicia.

Perhaps the best outcome after two builds would be:

F Gre
A Gal
A Bud
A Vie
A Ser

With this alignment and cooperation from Italy, Austria is setup to take command of the Balkans.

## Hungarian Houseboat (Austria)

A Vie – Bud
A Bud – Ser
F Tri – Hold

A strange opening that Frederico and I debated even including in a manual such as this. It is trusting of Russia but not of Italy.

In a speculative continuation, however, an Austro-Italian pairing that started with the Hungarian Houseboat and the Tyrolia Attack could dislodge and disband the Trieste fleet while disguising their partnership with Italian A Ven – Tri and A Tyr S Ven – Tri.

This way, the partnership trades the Austrian fleet for a future Austrian army to join a dangerous corps of red troops wreaking havoc in the Balkans.

## Southern Hedgehog

A Vie – Gal
A Bud – Ser
F Tri – Ven

I received a letter once from a mysterious address (always a new one when from Frederico), but I could not believe the game it described. Frederico had played the Southern Hedgehog. I chalked it up to failed negotiations, but perhaps Mr. Barbosa had taken over his consciousness for Spring 1901. It was the only explanation.

All things being equal, the Southern Hedgehog is a good opening:

A Vie – Gal bounces a Russian A War – Gal.

A Bud – Ser prepares to collect the neutral supply center.

F Tri – Ven breaks up the Tyrolian Attack. As a reminder…

Italy:
A Ven – Tyr
A Rom – Ven
F Nap – ION

Italy would end up with A Tyr and A Rom prior to Fall 1901 instead of A Tyr and A Ven both adjacent to Trieste.

The downside of course is that Italy has not played like this and the thrust into Ven makes it difficult to work together in the opening, when Frederico suggests Italy and Austria *must* align their interests.

A further downside is that without F Tri – Alb, there is no chance at Greece.

## The Splits (England)

F Edi – NWG
F Lon – ENG
A Lvp – Yor/Edi/Wal

Why not? Such an opening displays confidence in several ways.

The first: A confidence bordering on arrogance that the North Sea need not be occupied in 1901.

The second: To sail south into the English Channel without the backup of F Edi – NTH seems eclectic. It does serve a purpose, however. In the event the fleet bounces with French F Bre – ENG, England may order F Lon – NTH in Fall 1901 and open London for a build (which he will get from F NWG – Nor. (It must be said that the variety of tricks to be played against Germany are forfeited without F NTH.)

Meanwhile, what is done with the army is suggestive. A Lvp – Yor for flexibility. A Lvp – Wal to prepare for the possibility of a convoy to the European mainland. A Lvp – Edi for a convoy to Norway. These subtleties are not to be overlooked nor undersold. Frederico, when opening with The Splits, was often keen to lay the opening scenes of narratives that would unfold, usually in his favor, as the game progressed into 1902 and beyond.

## Western (England)

F Edi – Cly
F Lon – ENG
A Lvp – Wal

I must confess when Frederico wrote me about this opening my first thought was I must have drunk too much the prior evening, and my second thought was that I’d misread it.

No and no. Clyde really was the destination of the Edinburgh fleet. On its way to NAO or IRI in Fall to get a jump on a French campaign.

In the game in question, Frederico also managed to land an army in Belgium with F ENG C Wal – Bel, while France defended Brest and therefore could not place a new fleet there.

A second English army arrived on the mainland in 1902. Once France was done away with, England continued into the Mediterranean, and Germany pressed into Scandinavia and Russia.

What happened, you ask? Did Frederico manage to get the best of the German and solo this game, too? If you have to ask…

## Southern (England)

F Edi – NTH
F Lon – ENG
A Lvp – Yor/Wal

When Mr. Barbosa was at the reins, a common opening indeed.

Mr. Barbosa, ever the straight-shooter, nevertheless occasionally used the Southern Opening as a feint in a delayed English-French combination against Germany.

## Northern (England)

F Edi – NWG
F Lon – NTH
A Lvp – Yor/Edi/Wal

Quiet and flexible, allowing supported moves or convoys into Norway, for starters. If the French is onside, England can seize Saint Petersburg by Fall 1902 without concerns of the Frenchman moving in the Irish side door.

The additional northern fleet has multiple other benefits, mentioned previously in discussions from Russia’s perspective.

The first is that it can meddle with Germany in either of Holland or Denmark. The Danish Croissant, made famous by Frederico, involves the Russian boldly claiming he is going F BOT – BAL (angry with the German over a potential bounce in Sweden) and tipping off England to this plan. When the German attempts to bounce Russia with F Den – BAL, Russia instead plays F BOT – Swe and England swoops in with F NTH – Den.

England could also use NTH to head off a German Jutland Gambit by bouncing German F Den – SKA with F NTH – SKA. (If the German is *actually* going for this and the English player should like to punish him, F NTH – Den prevents the build with the oncoming A Kie – Den.) Merely bouncing in SKA could still see England and Germany work together since England could argue he wanted to improve his position against Russia.

A second and perhaps more common use of the fleet in NTH is that it allows the English player to reliably make gestures to France or Germany with regard to Belgium.

## Atlantic, The Vineyard (France)

ATLANTIC, THE VINEYARD

F Bre – MAO
A Mar – Bur
A Par – Gas

The Vineyard gives the French player substantive chances to gain Portugal and Spain while also affecting Belgium’s outcome.

## Atlantic, Gascony Variation (France)

F Bre – MAO
A Mar – Spa
A Par – Gas

A quiet opening that Frederico gradually inclined me towards. If France is the target, a fleet build in Bre (or even in Mar) can transpose into a French convoy from, say, Gascony or Picardy, into Wales or Liverpool in 1902 or 1903.

Certainly, a French player can have a good game powering through into the German homeland with English naval help (or even an English army convoyed into Belgium or Holland), but the English/French combination is somewhat in favor of England as the game stretches on.

## English Attack (France)

F Bre – ENG
A Mar – Spa
A Par – Bur

If your plan is to attack England, why not get started early? The English will often not risk bouncing in ENG–having better things to do–and perhaps you’ve even tipped him off that Russia is ordering A Mos – StP, so he better play F Edi – NWG and F Lon – NTH to ensure he can pick up Norway.

One path to a solo victory is to see the English decline early, and to ensure the French pieces are better positioned than the German’s to collect the spoils. From there, perhaps Russia is inclined to assist in the dismantling of Germany. With good timing, Austria or Turkey will be poised to attack Russia just as the anti-German campaign kicks off such that your French armies decisively gain the German homeland.

## Atlantic, Maginot Variation (France)

F Bre – MAO
A Mar – Bur
A Par S Mar – Bur

This approach ensure the French have a say in Belgium (even if the Frenchman doesn’t prefer it for himself) and a good chance to collect Portugal and Spain.

“Don’t be too eager to collect Belgium in 1901,” Frederico warned.

Then, Mr. Barbosa, the next day, “If you can steamroll into Belgium for six units in 1901, then you are well on your way to a solo!”

It was not often I caught Mr. Barbosa so boisterous. Perhaps it was something he ate. As such, I sided with Frederico on the Belgium question. I was happy to own it, but only if I also had a partnership established with either of England or Germany.

## Dutch, Burgundy Variation (Germany)

F Kie – Hol
A Ber – Kie
A Mun – Bur

Not preferred by Frederico nor myself, however useful to feint the desire for three builds, or, indeed, the actual total acquisition of six centers by year’s end 1901.

The opening’s weakness is that, although overtly friendly toward Russia (who will walk into Sweden), it suggests greed which either the English could meet by denying your A Kie – Den or the French A Bur – Mun (if he has in Spring supported himself into Bur).

## Anschluss (Germany)

F Kie – Den
A Ber – Kie
A Mun – Bur

The Burgundy Variation of the Anschluss establishes a bounce with France in Burgundy to keep the German army in Munich flexible for Fall 1901 (and beyond). The key is to ensure that Austria has a good early game. A strong Austria, for example, means the Russian is not too strong, and that a middle game offensive into Scandinavia and even northern Russia remains a possibility for the German.

## Rhineland (Germany)

F Kie – Den
A Ber – Mun
A Mun – Ruh

In shorter games, preparing to break into France for quick gains was not unheard of, at least in Mr. Barbosa’s repertoire. He often found a steadfast partner in England for this straightforward approach, and the Rhineland was an opening of choice for such an opening sequence.

My own hesitations aside, I saw the effectiveness of the outright German-English attack from the French side, especially if Italy was tipped off as well and annoyingly progressing into Piedmont.

“Only for short games or in tournaments where the French player has already scored well in previous games.”

(I should mention that we did manage to setup one tournament in the Paris underground. Its tunnels were suitable for discreet negotiations. I cannot confirm, however, that we ended the tournament with the same number of players as we started. Some players seemed to drift off into the darkness.)

## Blitzkrieg, Danish Variation (Germany)

F Kie – Den
A Ber – Kie
A Mun – Ruh

A delectable opening with the option of continuing with the Jutland Gambit, a favorite of Frederico’s, discussed at this section’s conclusion.

“Mind you don’t see an antagonistic French army in Burgundy,” warns Frederico. “Better you encourage the Frenchman to open passively, perhaps with A Mar – Spa and A Par – Gas (the Iberian Indecision) or–if the Frenchman insists on Burgundy because of your perceived skill level with the German pieces–the reciprocal insistence should be deployed come Fall sending that unit to Belgium to bounce the English’s convoy.”

F Den is free in Fall to bounce the Russian with F Den – Swe if it appears the Russian is up to no good in the South. Otherwise, it became a near-standard of Frederico’s to establish good relations with the Russian at least with regard to Sweden. “After all, I can’t fight everyone at once,” said Frederico, “but I can get them to fight each other.” What he was saying in a roundabout way was that a German moving north to control Scandinavia was often a good path to victory, assuming games with sufficiently long time controls.

## Alpine (Italy)

A Ven – Pie
A Rom – Ven
F Nap – ION

Arguably the most dynamic of openings for Italy. Is A Pie used for A Pie – Mar?, or might it swing eastward with A Pie – Tyr?

Keeping in mind the wise suggestion of Frederico to patiently build strategic influence, does this opening sacrifice too much of Italy’s latent upside by irritating its neighbors?

## Panther / Shuffle (Italy)

A Ven – Pie
A Rom – Apu
F Nap – ION

The Panther angles for a Central Power (A/G/I) combination to pressure both France and Turkey from the start.

The key move from the Italian perspective is in Fall 1901, where A Apu – Alb is achieved by Austria F ADR C Apu – Alb. This additional Balkan army can be used in several ways to take Greece and continue pushing itself or Austrian units into Bul.

F ADR C Apu – Alb
In this example, Germany assists the Italian army in Piedmont into Marseille. Meanwhile, the Austrian convoys the Italian army in Apulia to Albania. A smashing start for the Center Powers.

The strengths of thee Panther: it is used to establish a fast attack against France and Turkey. It builds trust between the Central Powers and the potential for early gains.

England and Russia shouldn’t be unhappy to see the Central Powers working together, at least considering the fact that England could very well be glad for a weakened France, and Russia for a distressed Turkey. They may ask what they are getting from this Central Power arrangement, however.

In the middle game, Italy is well-poised to make plays against either of his early game allies in Germany and Austria. With accurate play, Italy can control the Mediterranean.

Alternatives to the Panther / Shuffle: I’ve called this opening the ‘Panther / Shuffle’ because Italy can choose to transpose into the Alpine Shuffle, which in Fall 1901 orders A Pie – Tyr and repositions for leverage against Austria. But is it really better than the Alpine Chicken (Andrew Goff’s Diplomacy Openings)?

## Tyrolia Attack (Italy)

A Ven – Tyr
A Rom – Ven
F Nap – ION

If you are out for the Austrian (and you believe he will defend well in Fall 1901), possibly followup with A Tyr – Boh and A Ven – Tyr and build A Ven. This sequence puts three units on Trieste in Spring 1902. If you take this approach, be sure to alert the German. He can’t do much to prevent you moving A Tyr – Boh and A Ven – Tyr, but he will be very interested in what you plan to accomplish with those units precariously positioned at his eastern flank.

Strategically, such an out-and-out attack against Austria is double-edged. While Italy is likely to gain one or two centers, what is his plan thereafter? (In a short, time-bound game, this opening is quite viable.)

Ideally, and if the game is not time-bound (and under a scoring system leaning it toward big center counts and solos), one would like to work with Russia or Turkey against the other, preferably with Russia against Turkey. This way, Italy arguably has the best chances to solo.

Playing this way will forgo a convoy to Tunis, which should put the Turk at ease and allow you to possibly collaborate against Austria, should that be desirable. Keep in mind that Turkey is likely to be a point of mid-game tension in the Mediterranean, beginning with ION, AEG, and Gre, unless a delicate collaboration is established.

If Russia has made his way into Galicia, or does so by 1902, then Italy and Russia can have a good game carving Austria and then Turkey.

The quieter, though assertive Tyrolian Lepanto puts an army in Tyrolia with options. As u/MikhailGorbachef notes:

It gives you more options. From Tyr, you can help Austria defend Vienna, do shenanigans around Munich either with or against Germany, or even keep pushing north into Bohemia to fight with or against Russia. Plus you can always switch things around and just swing at Trieste just as easily as you could from Ven. More reasons for more people to talk to you.

You can also still force him back out of Venice no problem, unless he also moves an army down to support Venice to hold (very rare, and usually means he’s extremely vulnerable to RT as a result), or France opens to Piedmont and helps him (similarly rare).

It is a somewhat tricky opening to negotiate without spooking anyone, but has its advantages. A Ven hold, more broadly, is my least favorite thing to do with that piece – even an arranged bounce in Piedmont is better, because it at least tells you where someone else is moving, and still leaves you in Venice.

u/MikhailGorbachef

## Tyrolian Lepanto (Italy)

A Ven – Tyr
A Rom – Apu
F Nap – ION

Already in these I predict ‘early days’ of Diplomacy, the Lepanto, developed by Edi Birsan–with the intention of convoying an army into, say, Syria, in Fall 1902–has come into and out of favor. The Lepanto which seeks to split Turkey between Austria, Russia, and Italy, isn’t weak, though it is deliberate (slow). In scoring systems where the game is also timebound, Italy may not have the patience–nor is it strategically best–to go this route. 

Opening like this does allow one the flexibility to transpose into a traditional Lepanto if the situation suggests it, but I have for the time being concluded that the convoy into Syr or even Smy (if you’re lucky) is something of a dead-end for Italy. If one has arranged a strong Russian-Italian alliance, which aims to misconfigure Austria next, it isn’t a terrible approach. My point is it need not be the default.

The Tyrolian army should give you leverage or the ability to assist Austria if you prefer an Austria-Italian collaboration to open the game. If Austria balks, remind him that you have not followed up A Ven – Tyr with A Rom – Ven (The Tyrolia Attack).

More important is to figure out a strategic plan that puts you into the mid-game where Italy really shines. In some games, your fifth center may be Trieste (with Austria’s blessing), in others, Greece. With the opening to Tyrolia, it may even be Munich.

## Southern System, Rumanian (Russia)

A Mos – Sev
A War – Ukr
F Sev – Rum
F StP(sc) – BOT

Looking for a fairly non-committal and defensive approach? Look no further than the Southern System. If one so wishes, and the Austrian is inclined, the Bulgarian Gambit–attempting to dislodge the Turkish army in Bul–may be attempted in Fall 1901. However, the opening should not necessarily be seen as anti-Turkish. (See Strengths below.)

If Russia expects to be bounced by Germany’s F Den – Swe in Sweden, then she may elect to secure Rumania immediately in Spring 1901. In cases where you are nearly 100% confident of German F Den – Swe, you might opt for F GOB – BAL instead.

With F Sev – Rum, A Mos – Sev will succeed and establish the ability to support F Rum to hold in Fall 1901.

If Turkey is wary of the move South, remind him that with your army in Sev, he will not see a second southern fleet being built in Sev. Of course, in certain circumstances, you may opt for A Sev – Arm and put down a fleet in Sev.

While not a common opening, the Southern System is flexible and viable when Russia is uncertain of his southern neighbor’s openings and unsure of Germany’s intentions. With Turkey likely to be occupying the Black Sea, Russia will have to negotiate delicately. Richard Sharp does not recommend it, but I see value in certain situations already described.

## Northern System, The Squid (Russia)

A Mos – StP
A War – Ukr
F Sev – BLA
F StP(sc) – BOT

Similar to the Octopus (A War – Gal), The Squid puts immediate pressure on England to support himself into Norway. He will only gain the neutral with your good graces or by supporting himself in with fleets in NWG and NTH. If one is content to play an anti-English game from the start, putting the idea of F Lon – ENG in the English player’s mind–to defend against a possible French F Bre – ENG–is a useful ploy.

Sending two units north means you will have to be mindful of your approach in the south.

What are this opening's diplomatic advantages? 

Andrew Goff makes a great observation by way of a question: Who will be bothered by your northern opening?

Think about it. Maybe only England. But England was going to be in some conflict with you and may have walked into StP without some Russian northern presence in any case.

How about your other neighbors and Great Powers?

Germany will not be put off. France won’t mind. Italy too.

Austria will feel less immediate pressure, as will Turkey. Pressure can still be put upon Austria with the Octopus (A War – Gal).

This diplomatic advantage can be leveraged toward good relations in the south whilst Russia secures her northern flank. Then, assessing the position, Russia can decide where to build in 1901 and 1902 and be well-positioned to work with several or more neighbors.

Here’s a [well-put observation from Andrew](https://diplomacyopenings.wordpress.com/2015/11/30/in-his-house-at-rlyeh-dead-cthulhu-waits-dreaming/):

Whether this opening is better or worse than the closely related Octopus is a matter of personal taste, but the family of openings involving A Mos – StP are simply too good not to have a deep understanding of. As a new player you could do far worse than making this your default opening as Russia – it has challenges and requires universal engagement, but there is no better way to learn the game and the strengths of the opening give you every chance to have a successful game.

## Livonia System, Ukraine Variation (Russia)

A Mos – Lvn
A War – Ukr
F Sev – BLA
F StP(sc) – BOT

An outright attack on Germany with A War – Sil tends not to achieve much unless under certain scoring and game conditions where Germany needs to be put under immediate threat.

However, opening to Livonia does provide viable strategic options. It is an odd and unusual opening, which gives you the chance to explain it to your neighbors in various ways suiting your needs. It is not at all inflexible either. What’s more, as an objectively quieter opening, you will not be drawing too much unwanted attention to yourself.

In the first place, it allows for a convoy into Swe with A Lvn – Swe and F BOT C Lvn – Swe. When Germany has opened F Kie – Hol, the convoy cannot be stopped. When the German opens F Kie – Den, Russia should negotiate to allow the convoy to succeed (in exchange for a southern build). If Germany wavers, remind him to consider Russia’s alternate orders of A Lvn – Pru and F BOT – BAL. Further, if one wants to play such a game, Russia could even feign offense at the German’s unwillingness to allow F BOT – Swe and announce he will be ordering F BOT – BAL. Meanwhile, assuming Germany will take the bait, Russia continues to order his convoy and encourages England to order F NTH – Den (!).

Establishing the fact that one is capable of such a maneuver allows for more dynamic threats in future games. I say, Why not?

Additionally, A Lvn puts an army adjacent StP without committing it there in Spring 1901.

There are subtlities. As a small point: the way the pieces move makes A Mos – Ukr and A War – Liv seem less anti-German (if this opening can even be said to be anti-German) since the army in Warsaw seems to be moving away from Germany. Subtleties.

On Reddit, /u/wiithepiiple noted:

That is a funny bit of psychology. A Mos-Ukr/A War-Liv is tactically identical to A War-Ukr/A Mos-Liv, but feels different. I guess because the move to Liv draws your attention, and the other is a “normal” move that doesn’t. Russia’s opening major question is “where do you commit Moscow, north or south?” Moscow goes south? Russia wants to secure Rumania and attack Austria/Turkey. Moscow goes North? Russia wants to attack England’s Norway and Scandinavia. Warsaw doesn’t draw as much attention, unless it goes west.

u/wiithepiiple on r/diplomacy

For an approach that puts pressure on Austria, include A War – Gal instead of A War – Ukr.

## Ukraine System, Souther Variation (Russia)

A Mos – Ukr
A War – Gal
F Sev – BLA
F StP(sc) – BOT

Use the Ukraine System to remain flexible in the south and when you don’t need additional northern leverage.

The Ukraine System: Southern Variation beginning with A Mos – Ukr (and its variants) is flexible, setting Russia up for the neutral Sweden and Rumania. Frederico likes to suggest to Austria that A War – Gal is coming, and that A Gal – Rum (with A Ukr S Gal – Rum) is the plan for Fall 1901. By itself, the Austrian should not like to see a Russian army in Gal, but with the second part of your plan–removing that unit from Gal to reach Rum–the Austrian should be more comfortable with the Spring move. One way to make the success of the move more likely is to stir trouble between Austria and Italy prior to Spring 1901 moves.

What are the risks? With three southern units, Russia will have little early influence in the north. The move to Galicia may not be welcomed by the Austrian and delay any possible collaboration with the red units.

How about rewards? Unless you’ve diplomatically succeeded in avoiding a bounce in Gal, a careful Austrian will often bounce you there. This approach does give Russia more chances of securing Rumania, though depending on whether Russia stands to gain Sweden, forcing one’s way into Rumania is not always necessary to continue into a solid 1902, relationship in a good place with all neighbors. 

## Turkish Hedgehog (Turkey)

A Con – Bul
A Smy – Arm
F Ank – Con

A surprisingly viable and flexible opening for Turkey. 

Any variation of F Ank – Con in Spring 1901 can vibrate alarm bells across all of Europe, but the Turkish Hedgehog combines F Ank – Con with A Smy – Arm. The army in Armenia should be used as a diplomatic fact to dampen the signals of a Juggernaut (Russo-Turkish alliance).

Conveniently, such an opening could be used as the beginning move order to a Russian-Turkish alliance. Mr. Barbosa was not fond of the alliance, especially from the Turkish side.

With the Armenian army, the Turk puts Russia to a similar test as has already been discussed. “But look closer,” Mr. Barbosa urged me. Then I saw the following:

Fall 1901:
A Bul – Rum
A Arm – Sev
F Con – BLA

This continuation makes it very difficult indeed for the Russian to gain Rumania. More difficult than any other opening. (Unless of course, he is already there with Spring F Sev – Rum.)

Further, Turkey has the option to sail into the Aegean with F Con – AEG without contest. Whether you make plans with Italy, Austria, or Russia, your units are well placed to find leverage some kind of near-term alliance and quite possibly your fifth build in 1902 or 1903.

The Turkish Hedgehog will surely draw attention. How you use that attention is up to you. 

## Ship of the Desert (Turkey)

A mountaineer, storm-stained and brown
from farthest desert touched the town
And, striding through the town held, up
Above his head a jewell’d cup.
He put two fingers to his lip,
He whispere’d wild, he stood a-tip,
And lean’d the while with lifted hand,
And said, “a ship lies yonder dead,”
And said, “Doubloons lie sown in sand
along yon desert dead and brown,”

— Joaquin Miller 1875, The Ship in the Desert,
Roberts Brothers’ version.

A Con – Bul
A Smy – Con
F Ank – Arm ( ! )

Yes, your fleets can move along coastlines. And yes, you needn’t always play F Ank – BLA by default.

As with the Crimean Crusher opening, similar pressure is put on Russia to fulfill early game expectations of gaining Rum while maintaining Sev.

Openings like this play to Frederico’s flair and he was especially good at explaining his motives in numerous ways to his various opponents. With novelties comes the advantage of neighbors more open to nuanced explanations which serve your own interests more than theirs.

Tactically, F Arm provides the same threat to Sev with the bonus option of playing F Arm – BLA in Fall 1901 to either take BLA or cut support there depending on the Russian’s play. In most cases, Russia’s only guaranteed orders to take Rum will be to send the fleet. The best outcome could be to see Russia’s fleet land in Rum, a Russian army blocking a build in Sev (hedging against F Arm – Sev), and the success of F Arm – BLA.

From here, you can straightforwardly build F Smy and already be quite secure. Alternatively, you might build an additional army–to advance through Arm into Sev by Fall 1902–or F Ank to placate either of Austria or Italy.

## Crimean Crusher (Turkey)

A Con – Bul
A Smy – Arm
F Ank – BLA

The Crimean Crusher is another solid Turkish Diplomacy opening, giving diplomatic and strategic leverage against the Russian and with your neighbors Austria and Italy. 

With the Armenian army, immediate pressure is put on Sev. As a result, Russia is made to work harder to secure Rumania.

Imagine the confident negotiations you might have with each of your neighbors. Russia pleads for Rumania; Austria offers to help keep Russia out of Rumania; Italy asks for support into Greece. Having involved Italy in persuading the Russian to leave Sev open for a build of his own, you might swindle your way into Sev from Arm. (The Russian opts for F BLA – Rum and A Ukr S BLA – Rum to secure Rum, and so gives up BLA to your F Ank – BLA.)

It is a dream start, 2 builds from Bul and Sev, all too common for a diplomat like yourself. Build a fleet and an army and carry on into a steady mid-game and eventually stab Austria for your solo.

The Crimean Crusher is a solid opening that should be added to your repertoire when in command of Turkish units.

## Balkan Concentration (Turkey)

A Con – Bul
A Smy – Con
F Ank – BLA

This opening picks up the neutral supply center Bul (just as all the following will), and A Smy – Con means Con will be able to support Bul in the fall (even if Russia and Austria aim a supported attack against it). You will have your build.

Meanwhile, you likely bounce with Russia in BLA or take it yourself if Russia plays the Southern Opening, with F Sev – Rum.

In this way, you keep relationships with each of your neighbors viable. From here, you might use Bul to support an Austrian attack on Rumania, either from Serbia or Budapest. This approach had multiple advantages.

The first, that it angled for a Turkish-Austrian alliance that you can exploit to your benefit later.

Secondly, such a maneuver often keeps Russia from gaining Rumania and limited him to 1 or 0 builds (depending on Germany’s action or inaction toward Sweden). Russia would certainly not appreciate the Turk’s providing of assistance to Austria, but he needn’t be completely averse to working with you going forward.  

Finally, in situations where Italy was keen to disrupt or even attack Austria in Fall 1901, you could tip off Italy to the forthcoming Austrian orders. Perhaps Italy could even take Trieste or deny the Austrian fleet in Albania from securing Greece. This series of events might demonstrate to the Russian that he might yet have a friend in Turkey, given that the Russian by end of Fall 1901 is likely in Galicia and prepared to leverage that position to Austria’s detriment.  

“Where are you going to build?” someone may ask you.

Where indeed? The most obvious place would seem to be Smyrna. The most obvious unit, a fleet, which will then set sail to the Aegean Sea, possibly to be bounced by an Austrian or Italian fleet. In some games, where Italy and Austria are aligned, this defensive posture is necessary to keep Con and Smy safe. If you remain steadfast, perhaps you could turn either of the Italian and Austrian against the other. Or, at some point, the French may sail east and give you the releasing of naval pressure you need to break out of the corner.  

Another straightforward option might be a build of Fleet Ankara. The situation may call for the taking of the Black Sea and a push into either Sev or Rum. 

Speaking of Russian antagonism, the remaining Turkish openings are less friendly toward the Russian than the Balkan Concentration.
