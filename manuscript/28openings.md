# 28 Openings

Even though Opening Theory is fairly well established, it is worthwhile to review what you think you know, and to experience for yourself the nuances of starting the game with variations to your standard play. 

I recently was encouraged to see that Andrew Goff's 'Modern Borders' concept, an early-game alliance between Austria and Italy, actually works, for multiple reasons. In this case, as Austria, I also disguised the arrangement as an attack against me, a story which was bought by several players, giving me a few years of freedom I wouldn't have normally received in my club while playing the red pieces. (Especially in a Top Board scenario.)

As you proceed through the following general comments and 28 particular openings, don't lose sight of the importance of building relationships in the opening. These relationships are as important as choosing the correct theoretical or tactical opening. In fact, I will often refer to those relationships in discussing the openings. 

Finally, and I repeat, always bear in mind the scoring system you are playing under, as that should affect your strategy as well as other players' strategies.

## AUSTRIA

I quite like playing Austria. As with the Germans, they are in the center of the action, the fulcrum of negotiations, the gravitational force upon which the game is pulled.  

With Austria, you can be a poet, a puppet master, and a symbol of power. Your armies can move swiftly and decisively. Don't play scared. Instead, be fearless. Understand what your armies can do in pairs or groups of three, and don't forget to use your starting fleet wisely!

### 1901  

Many players with red worry over their survival. Instead, figure out with whom you can work. Any of your neighbors should be happy to work with you, at least in the short term. 

If with Italy, all the better. This way the Italian can contribute to a balance of power in the Western Theater whilst you find a second partner in either Turkey or Russia to carve up the other. 

Are you a new player? Make sure you order A Bud - Ser. Serbia is *such* a crucial supply center for supports and support-cutting throughout the game. That army will be busy. Doing anything else with A Bud is too risky for a normal game. 

There are some *very* fancy--perhaps too fancy--openings which call for A Vie - Gal and A Bud S Vie - Gal (with a dead solid Turkish ally), but I only recommend those in edge cases. 

![Austrian A Bud - Rum with Turkish Ally](/resources/austria-bud-rum.png)

One edge case would be a reliable Turkish collaborator in a short, time-bound game, where you can get a jump on Rumania while *possibly* giving Serbia to Turkey in 1901...this also calls for deliberate negotiations with Russia to first try sending Moscow north and second to lobby for a hold in War or A War - Ukr. 

![Austria holds Rum while Russia plays A StP - Nwy](/resources/austria-rumh2.png)

If you're sure Russia will play A War - Ukr and F Sev - BLA you can also go for A Vie - Gal and A Bud - Rum straight away in Spring 1901. Again, Turkey can be offered Serbia and you're best off keeping Italy onside as well so there isn't trouble in Trieste or with your F Alb - Gre.) 

![Turkey into Serbia, with Italy deciding the AT looks dangerous](/resources/austria-turkey-serbia.png)

In these scenarios, I'm unafraid of the apparently lopsided alliance with Turkey, understanding that if needed Italy can spare me a fleet or two to assist in bringing down the Turk once the Turk and I have crippled Russia. If Turkey is not inclined, I'm just as happy to work with the Russian. (The previous image could even be an arranged A Ven - Tri to lend Italy his fifth center while also staying the course with Turkey against Russia. Delicate Diplomacy needed!)

T> #### Why would Italy attack?
T>
T> After seeing Austria's Spring 1901 moves, why might Italy decide to take Trieste? As Austria, how could you manage the conversation given it looks like you are lining up against Russia? 

Continuations of the above--again, perhaps overly fancy opening--might include working with Turkey, Italy, or both. At the right moment, you should be able to break into Russia and at the right moment (this is a short, time-bound game remember?) you can steal back a few Balkan centers to top the board.

#### BEYOND 1902

Some Austrian diplomats don't think beyond 1902 until they've arrived there. But to forgo such potential is a mistake.

In games where you're under attack, try to glean the assistance of the German, prompting moves like A Mun - Tyr for protection of Trieste and Vienna.

And plan you should, else you be confronted with something like the following in Spring 1902: 

Russia:  
A Gal, A Rum  

Italy:  
A Tyr, A Ven  

Turkey:  
A Bul, F Smy  

Actually, the above is only too common (and there are worse scenarios), but an Austrian with an ounce of grit and a measure of panache will know how to work his neighbors to his own delight. If it seems like Italy has your number, play his game for awhile. If Turkey would like to work with you, do not be afraid. At one point, even in these seemingly weakened arrangements, the well-timed stab is a knife in your favor. Better still, you may even keep it sheathed well into the mid-game.  

#### ERIK'S CHOICE

Some variation of the Balkan Gambit. Making the right assessment with your Viennan army and simultaneously enchant your neighbors.

If not the Balkan Gambit, I like the 'Modern Borders' concept discussed previously. 


## Balkan Gambit (Austria)

![Balkan Gambit with A Vie - Gal](/resources/austria-balkangambit.png)

A Vie - Tri/Gal/Bud  
A Bud - Ser  
F Tri - Alb  

A great chance for two builds, arguably necessary for Austria, except in situations where an AI is combining in the 'Modern Borders' concept to put Italy in Trieste.

The question is what to do with A Vie. If the Russian can be persuaded to do something else with A War besides A War - Gal, then Austria can hedge against A Ven - Tri with A Vie - Tri. If you feel secure, you can go for A Vie - Bud and have a say in the futures of the kind people of Rumania.

## Galician Gambit (Austria)

![Galician Gambit](/resources/austria-galiciangambit.png)

A Vie – Tri
A Bud – Gal
F Tri – Alb

An opening that is suspicious of both Italy and Russia. Have your communications broken down already? 

Assuming a bounce in Galicia, this opening does allow the Austrian to support himself into Serbia with A Tri – Ser and A Bud S Tri – Ser. F Alb heads for Greece and a possible two-build Winter. Greece is no longer as clear a bet with Turkish A Bul and Italian F ION. 

Of course, with the right diplomacy, A Bud (again assuming a bounce with Russian A War – Gal) could also affect Rumania’s fate or try again for Galicia.

Perhaps the best outcome after two builds would be:

F Gre
A Gal
A Bud
A Vie
A Ser

With this alignment and cooperation from Italy, Austria is setup to take command of the Balkans.

## Hungarian Houseboat (Austria)

![Hungarian Houseboat](/resources/austria-hungarianhouseboat.png)

A Vie – Bud
A Bud – Ser
F Tri – Hold

A strange opening that is trusting of Russia but not of Italy.  

I debated even including in a manual such as this. Why then?  

In a speculative continuation, however, an Austro-Italian pairing that started with the Hungarian Houseboat and the Tyrolia Attack could dislodge and disband the Trieste fleet while disguising their partnership with Italian A Ven – Tri and A Tyr S Ven – Tri.  

This way, the partnership trades the Austrian fleet for a future Austrian army to join a dangerous corps of red troops wreaking havoc in the Balkans.  

## Southern Hedgehog (Austria)

![Southern Hedgehog](/resources/austria-southern-hedgehog.png)

A Vie – Gal  
A Bud – Ser  
F Tri – Ven  

All things being equal (there are no allies in sight!), the Southern Hedgehog is a good opening:

A Vie – Gal bounces a Russian A War – Gal.  

A Bud – Ser prepares to collect the neutral supply center.  

F Tri – Ven breaks up the Tyrolia Attack. As a reminder…  

Italy (The Tyrolia Attack):  
A Ven – Tyr  
A Rom – Ven  
F Nap – ION  

Italy would end up with A Tyr and A Rom prior to Fall 1901 instead of A Tyr and A Ven both adjacent to Trieste.

The downside of course is that Italy has not played like this and the thrust into Ven makes it difficult to work together in the opening, where Italy and Austria arguably *must* align their interests, at least under most scoring systems and regular player relationship dynamics.  

A further downside is that without F Tri – Alb, there is no chance at Greece. Do you let Turkey know your plans here? Or do you try to get his him to send A Smyrna to Armenia? 

T> #### Making the Most of Sub-Optimal Openings
T>
T> If you feel you must open F Tri - Ven, then having Turkish A Smy - Arm makes it impossible for Turkey to gain both Bulgaria and Greece (as the Sultan might have done having ordered A Con - Bul and A Smy - Con). How might you influence the Turk to open to Armenia? 
T>
T> Look for these small opportunities to influence your opponents so that the weaknesses in your sub-optimal openings aren't exposed so gratuitously.


## ENGLAND

As England you begin the game with two fleets, in Edinburgh and London. One would be too few. Three, too many. As my friend and competitor Jake Langenfeld reiterates:

> With England, you need to get armies on the mainland.

Indeed, in the Minnesota Diplomacy Club's inaugural Championship match, we saw England's lack of armies fail to offer any defense to the expanding Russian pieces played by board-topper Zachary Moore.

#### 1901

With England you can afford to play a quiet opening so long as it keeps a frisky Frenchman out of the English Channel. "Leverage on Belgium is all," is a nice reply if you find yourself there and face an angry "Quoi!?".  

My own taste is to feel out the Frenchman's own theory on the matter before making a decision. As with all Diplomacy decisions, it is situational.  

Don't be afraid of getting creative with England to gain leverage. For example, what does F NTH - SKA in Fall 1901 gain you? Under what conditions could you get away with this? 

![F NTH - SKA in Fall 1901](/resources/FNTH-SKA.png)

In MNDC2020 Game 01 I got away with F NTH - SKA which led to profitable discussions with both Germany and Russia in Fall 1901. (Russia had built in the south so could not pressure Norway immediately.) I ended up working with Germany who supported my F Nwy - Swe, dislodging Russia's fleet. 

#### BEYOND 1902

Perhaps Englands' best choice for a partnership is with Germany. Even if Germany has the better of the arrangement, England's positioning of a mere two fleets--in the North Sea and the English Channel / Skagerrak--can in a flash transpose into armies in the Low Countries or Denmark. Once England has expanded his reach, fleets in NTH and BAL can quickly carry troops for a chance to break through the stalemate line into Warsaw or Moscow.   

#### ERIK’S CHOICE

I tend to play the most standard and common opening with fleets to NTH and NWG and the army based on the situation to Edi, Yor, or Wal.  


## The Splits (England)

![The Splits with A Lvp - Wal](/resources/england-splits.png)

F Edi – NWG  
F Lon – ENG  
A Lvp – Yor/Edi/Wal  

Why not? Such an opening displays confidence in several ways.  

The first: A confidence bordering on arrogance that the North Sea need not be occupied in 1901.  
The second: To sail south into the English Channel without the backup of F Edi – NTH seems eclectic. It does serve a purpose, however. In the event the fleet bounces with French F Bre – ENG, England may order F Lon – NTH in Fall 1901 and open London for a build (which he will get from F NWG – Nor. (It must be said that the variety of tricks to be played against Germany are forfeited without F NTH.)  

Meanwhile, what is done with the army is suggestive. A Lvp – Yor for flexibility. A Lvp – Wal to prepare for the possibility of a convoy to the European mainland. A Lvp – Edi for a convoy to Norway. These subtleties are not to be overlooked nor undersold.  

## Western (England)

![The Western](/resources/england-western.png)

F Edi – Cly  
F Lon – ENG  
A Lvp – Wal  

You have not overdrunk the wine. Clyde really is the destination of the Edinburgh fleet. On its way to NAO or IRI in Fall to get a jump on a French campaign.

Maybe you can manage to land an army in Belgium with F ENG C Wal – Bel, while France defends Brest and therefore cannot place a new fleet there in Winter.

A second English army arrives on the mainland in 1902. Once France is done away with, England continues into the Mediterranean, and Germany presses into Scandinavia and Russia.  

## Southern (England)

![Southern](/resources/england-southern.png)

F Edi – NTH  
F Lon – ENG  
A Lvp – Yor/Wal  

Occasionally to be used as a feint in a delayed English-French combination against Germany. With A Lvp - Wal, this is also a cheeky way to get the convoy into Norway whilst affecting Belgium or even taking it (with F ENG - Bel) as a compromise with either France or Germany.  

## Northern (England)

![Northern](/resources/england-northern.png)

F Edi – NWG  
F Lon – NTH  
A Lvp – Yor/Edi/Wal  

Quiet and flexible, allowing supported moves or convoys into Norway, for starters. If the French is onside, England can seize Saint Petersburg by Fall 1902 without concerns of the Frenchman moving in the Irish side door.

If one is very sure of France's F Bre - MAO, then A Lvp - Edi provides leverage for profitable negotiations with Russia. You might ask, "How can we work together in 1902 if I take Norway with F NWG - Nwy in lieu of convoying the army?" Unless Russia has the potential builds to make life difficult, the Bear may be inclined to assist you into Denmark at some point versus risking natural moves into Sweden or Saint Petersburg in 1902 or 1903.  

The additional northern fleet has multiple other benefits, mentioned shortly in discussions from Russia’s perspective.

The first is that it can meddle with Germany in either of Holland or Denmark. The Danish Croissant involves the Russian boldly claiming he is going F BOT – BAL (angry with the German over a potential bounce in Sweden) and tipping off England to this plan. When the German attempts to bounce Russia with F Den – BAL, Russia instead plays F BOT – Swe and England swoops in with F NTH – Den.

England could also use NTH to head off a German Jutland Gambit by bouncing German F Den – SKA with F NTH – SKA. (If the German is *actually* going for this and the English player should like to punish him, F NTH – Den prevents the build with the oncoming A Kie – Den.) Merely bouncing in SKA could still see England and Germany work together since England could argue he wanted to improve his position against Russia.

A second and perhaps more common use of the fleet in NTH is that it allows the English player to reliably make gestures to France or Germany with regard to Belgium.  


## FRANCE

While France doesn't have the dynamism of other powers, I do have a fondness for France.

#### 1901

While it could be annoying to see the Englishman in ENG, the German in Bur, and the Italian in Pie, even this will not be the end of France's game. The Iberian peninsula holds two easy supply centers and routes to a good draw may continue with either German or French partnership (sometimes both if you fancy the Western Triple).  

#### BEYOND 1902

France can do well with either of England or Germany onside, or even both, in the notorious Western Triple, which gets a jump on the Eastern theater. The Western Triple is decisive but more or less useful depending on the scoring system at hand.  

If France aims for a good draw or a solo, he likely will opt to partner with either of the English or the German. In a game where he must solo, he needs a plan to dismantle England, else England could reach the annoying 7-center stalemate position with the right maneuvers. Most English players will not be so clinical tactically, yet if a solo is desired, the French diplomat would do well to lay plans and create routes to the English isles at the right moment in the late early game or early mid-game. 

#### ERIK’S CHOICE

In longer games, I prefer to play a quiet opening as France. The Iberian Indecision (F Bre - MAO, A Par - Gas, A Mar - Spa) might be my quirky favorite, leaving options flexible and the squabbles over Burgundy to the English and German. This approach allows the game to develop and come to you, so to speak.  

My preferences tend toward sending at least one unit to Burgundy, even though a German unit there by itself does not threaten France overly much. Better not to come across as weak and begin to change Germany's good opinion of you too early in the festivities.  

In one game, I faired quite well by sending my southern army first to Piedmont and then into Tyrolia! This approach, which can be used by other Great Powers as well, lends itself to discussions of Scatter Theory.  

France has many paths to good draws. It almost always has play in the middle game and can build fleets in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. Its home centers' distance from key central territories sometimes make solos elusive against strong opponents willing to establish stalemate lines. Nevertheless, a comfortable and enjoyable Great Power to command.  



## Atlantic, The Vineyard (France)

F Bre – MAO  
A Mar – Bur  
A Par – Gas  

The Vineyard gives the French player substantive chances to gain Portugal and Spain while also affecting Belgium’s outcome.  

## Atlantic, Gascony Variation (France)

F Bre – MAO  
A Mar – Spa  
A Par – Gas  

A quiet opening I've gradually become inclined towards. If England is the target, a fleet build in Bre (or even in Mar) can transpose into a French convoy from, say, Gascony or Picardy, into Wales or Liverpool in 1902 or 1903.  

Certainly, a French player can have a good game powering through into the German homeland with English naval help (or even an English army convoyed into Belgium or Holland), but the English/French combination is somewhat in favor of England as the game stretches on.  

## English Attack (France)

F Bre – ENG  
A Mar – Spa  
A Par – Bur  

If your plan is to attack England, why not get started early? The English will often not risk bouncing in ENG–having better things to do–and perhaps you’ve even tipped him off that Russia is ordering A Mos – StP, so he better play F Edi – NWG and F Lon – NTH to ensure he can pick up Norway.

One path to a solo victory is to see the English decline early, and to ensure the French pieces are better positioned than the German’s to collect the spoils. From there, perhaps Russia is inclined to assist in the dismantling of Germany. With good timing, Austria or Turkey will be poised to attack Russia just as the anti-German campaign kicks off such that your French armies decisively gain the German homeland.  

## Atlantic, Maginot Variation (France)

F Bre – MAO  
A Mar – Bur  
A Par S Mar – Bur  

This approach ensure the French have a say in Belgium (even if the Frenchman doesn’t prefer it for himself) and a good chance to collect Portugal and Spain.

Don’t be too eager to collect Belgium in 1901. But if you can steamroll to six and beyond against weak opponents, that's fine as well.   

I am generally happy to own it, but only if I also have a partnership established with either of England or Germany. 

## GERMANY

A central power with a lot to do and a lot to play for. With neighbors in France, England, Russia, Italy, and Austria, the German diplomat will be speaking with all other players for most of the game.  

At least until they are eliminated.  

1901

By numerics, Germany has a comparable range of openings to Russia, but a review of its early game advantages, priorities, and relationships narrows the German's focus.  

Like France and England, Germany will have to take a stance with regard to Belgium's future. With France, Burgundy will likely be discussed. With Russia, Sweden and the Baltic.

#### BEYOND 1902

To be at the helm of Germany is an exciting treat for most keen diplomats. You begin the game with the all important center: Munich. Routes to strong mid-game position are several, through Scandinavia, across the North Sea to England, and even into the heart of France. Keep the East balanced long enough and when you turn your sights in that direction, the remaining powers may not be able to stop your advance.

#### ERIK’S CHOICE

One of my favorite continuations of the Danish Blitzkrieg is the Jutland Gambit:

F Den-SKA  
A Kie-Den  
A Ruh-Hol  

This gives Germany two builds (likely F Kie and A Mun) and a good game in either Scandinavia or in tandem with the French against England.



## Dutch, Burgundy Variation (Germany)

F Kie – Hol  
A Ber – Kie  
A Mun – Bur  

Not preferred by Frederico nor myself, however useful to feint the desire for three builds, or, indeed, the actual total acquisition of six centers by year’s end 1901.

The opening’s weakness is that, although overtly friendly toward Russia (who will walk into Sweden), it suggests greed which either the English could meet by denying your A Kie – Den or the French A Bur – Mun (if he has in Spring supported himself into Bur).

## Anschluss (Germany)

F Kie – Den
A Ber – Kie
A Mun – Bur

The Burgundy Variation of the Anschluss establishes a bounce with France in Burgundy to keep the German army in Munich flexible for Fall 1901 (and beyond). The key is to ensure that Austria has a good early game. A strong Austria, for example, means the Russian is not too strong, and that a middle game offensive into Scandinavia and even northern Russia remains a possibility for the German.

## Rhineland (Germany)

F Kie – Den  
A Ber – Mun  
A Mun – Ruh  

In shorter games, preparing to break into France for quick gains is not unheard of. Find a steadfast partner in England for this straightforward approach; the Rhineland was an opening of choice for such an opening sequence.

The outright German-English attack from the French side is effectivee, especially if Italy is tipped off as well and annoyingly progressing into Piedmont.  

Consider also: Using such an approach defends Munich while also having a say in Belgium even when you are unsure about France and England out of the gates. 

## Blitzkrieg, Danish Variation (Germany)

F Kie – Den  
A Ber – Kie  
A Mun – Ruh  

A delectable opening with the option of continuing with the Jutland Gambit.

Mind you don’t see an antagonistic French army in Burgundy. Better you encourage the Frenchman to open passively, perhaps with A Mar – Spa and A Par – Gas (the Iberian Indecision) or–if the Frenchman insists on Burgundy because of your perceived skill level with the German pieces–the reciprocal insistence should be deployed come Fall sending that unit to Belgium to bounce the English’s convoy.

F Den is free in Fall to bounce the Russian with F Den – Swe if it appears the Russian is up to no good in the South. Otherwise, it is a near-standard of mine to establish good relations with the Russian at least with regard to Sweden. After all, I can’t fight everyone at once but I can get them to fight each other. Said another way: As the German, moving north to control Scandinavia is often a good path to victory, assuming games with sufficiently long time controls.  

## ITALY

Perhaps the most difficult for new players, Italy has risen significantly in status, both in results collected from our network of gamemasters throughout Europe, and in my own heart.

#### 1901

More than any other power, it matters little how Italy wants to start the game. Italy's strength is its strategic influence, its ability to tilt the game in various directions, its implicit threat to do so.  

#### BEYOND 1902

For Italy, nearly all of the game of Diplomacy lies beyond 1902. To impatiently flail for unplanned centers may prompt a coalition against you. To ask for more than your fair share in an early game collaboration could mark you as greedy. To launch headfirst into a forlorn, lazy Lepanto, a shrug on your shoulders, should likewise be avoided.  

Instead, charm your neighbors; strike an alliance with Austria if you can; stay onside with France (until the right moment, usually well into the mid-game); and find a path to a fifth center whilst maintaining strategic leverage.  

The rest of the board hinges so much on what Italy does. Demonstrate that you understand this, and don't waste such power. 

ERIK’S CHOICE

Any opening which under short time controls sees me decimate Austria, or, under normal time controls, allied with the Austrian for an extended time.    


## Alpine (Italy)

A Ven – Pie
A Rom – Ven
F Nap – ION

Arguably the most dynamic of openings for Italy. Is A Pie used for A Pie – Mar?, or might it swing eastward with A Pie – Tyr?

But if your early game strength as Italy is derived from strategic influence, does this opening sacrifice too much of Italy’s latent upside by irritating its neighbors?  

## Panther / Shuffle (Italy)

A Ven – Pie
A Rom – Apu
F Nap – ION

The Panther angles for a Central Power (A/G/I) combination to pressure both France and Turkey from the start.

The key move from the Italian perspective is in Fall 1901, where A Apu – Alb is achieved by Austria F ADR C Apu – Alb. This additional Balkan army can be used in several ways to take Greece and continue pushing itself or Austrian units into Bul.

F ADR C Apu – Alb
In this example, Germany assists the Italian army in Piedmont into Marseille. Meanwhile, the Austrian convoys the Italian army in Apulia to Albania. A smashing start for the Center Powers.

The strengths of the Panther: it is used to establish a fast attack against France and Turkey. It builds trust between the Central Powers and the potential for early gains.

England and Russia shouldn’t be unhappy to see the Central Powers working together, at least considering the fact that England could very well be glad for a weakened France, and Russia for a distressed Turkey. They may ask what they are getting from this Central Power arrangement, however.

In the middle game, Italy is well-poised to make plays against either of his early game allies in Germany and Austria. With accurate play, Italy can control the Mediterranean.

Alternatives to the Panther / Shuffle: I’ve called this opening the ‘Panther / Shuffle’ because Italy can choose to transpose into the Alpine Shuffle, which in Fall 1901 orders A Pie – Tyr and repositions for leverage against Austria. But is it really better than the Alpine Chicken?

## Tyrolia Attack (Italy)

A Ven – Tyr
A Rom – Ven
F Nap – ION

If you are out for the Austrian (and you believe he will defend well in Fall 1901), possibly followup with A Tyr – Boh and A Ven – Tyr and build A Ven. This sequence puts three units on Trieste in Spring 1902. If you take this approach, be sure to alert the German. He can’t do much to prevent you moving A Tyr – Boh and A Ven – Tyr, but he will be very interested in what you plan to accomplish with those units precariously positioned at his eastern flank.

Strategically, such an out-and-out attack against Austria is double-edged. While Italy is likely to gain one or two centers, what is his plan thereafter? (In a short, time-bound game, this opening is quite viable.)

Ideally, and if the game is not time-bound (and under a scoring system leaning it toward big center counts and solos), one would like to work with Russia or Turkey against the other, preferably with Russia against Turkey. This way, Italy arguably has the best chances to solo.

Playing this way will forgo a convoy to Tunis, which should put the Turk at ease and allow you to possibly collaborate against Austria, should that be desirable. Keep in mind that Turkey is likely to be a point of mid-game tension in the Mediterranean, beginning with ION, AEG, and Gre, unless a delicate collaboration is established.

If Russia has made his way into Galicia, or does so by 1902, then Italy and Russia can have a good game carving Austria and then Turkey.

The quieter, though assertive Tyrolian Lepanto puts an army in Tyrolia with options. 

## Tyrolian Lepanto (Italy)

A Ven – Tyr
A Rom – Apu
F Nap – ION

Already in these I predict ‘early days’ of Diplomacy, the Lepanto, developed by Edi Birsan–with the intention of convoying an army into, say, Syria, in Fall 1902–has come into and out of favor. The Lepanto which seeks to split Turkey between Austria, Russia, and Italy, isn’t weak, though it is deliberate (slow). In scoring systems where the game is also timebound, Italy may not have the patience–nor is it strategically best–to go this route. 

Opening like this does allow one the flexibility to transpose into a traditional Lepanto if the situation suggests it, but I have for the time being concluded that the convoy into Syr or even Smy (if you’re lucky) is something of a dead-end for Italy. If one has arranged a strong Russian-Italian alliance, which aims to misconfigure Austria next, it isn’t a terrible approach. My point is it need not be the default.

The Tyrolian army should give you leverage or the ability to assist Austria if you prefer an Austria-Italian collaboration to open the game. If Austria balks, remind him that you have not followed up A Ven – Tyr with A Rom – Ven (The Tyrolia Attack).

More important is to figure out a strategic plan that puts you into the mid-game where Italy really shines. In some games, your fifth center may be Trieste (with Austria’s blessing), in others, Greece. With the opening to Tyrolia, it may even be Munich.


## RUSSIA

I enjoy playing Russia.   

Why? The Russian must stay as busy as any diplomat in the early years. To begin with, he is arguably playing as two separate powers of two centers each. Opponents, though, will not cease to remind him he has four units at his disposal, or five or six after 1901. But even a six-center Russia is not overwhelmingly strong after 1901 and will have much to do.  

Russia's ability to build fleets on both sides of the primary stalemate line (from Saint Petersburg to Spain) is important. Russia may not perform quite as well as expected in non-timebound draw-based systems, but performs quite well in time bound sum-of-square, dominance, or solo-based scoring measures.  

#### 1901

Request Sweden with the overture of friendship. Explain to Germany that the build will be used in the South. The dormant threat of F Swe - Bal must be real else the German has little immediate incentive to gift Sweden.  

Rumania is less straightforward.  

Except in rare situations where Austria desires to combine against Bulgaria in Fall 1901, I prefer not to open with F Sev - Rum (this allows Turkey into BLA). Instead, my default became to play F Sev - BLA while suggesting the Turk open F Ank - Con. You can always fight later, but at least there is the possibility of Russo-Turkish cooperation. Seldom have I found Turks very willing to play this way without also opening to Armenia as a hedge, but it is worth a shot.  

The lovely thing about Russia's numerous openings is that many of them may be transposed into several strong continuations, no matter your Spring diplomacy.  

Where you eventually build in Winter 1901 could even further keep options open for 1902 and beyond.  

#### BEYOND 1902

The Tsar's game can be quite strong even without a clear early game ally. If one does find direct cooperation, Russia can secure either a foothold in Scandinavia, the Balkans, or Turkey, entering the mid-game with 7-9 centers and everything to play for. Because Russia can build armies and fleets on both sides of the primary stalemate line, routes to a large draw or a solo are numerous.  

#### ERIK’S CHOICE

If you really want to spice things up, try F Sev - Arm. This should show your hand to Austria and with luck he will go along with your plans to take down Turkey. In that case, you have the annoying F Arm (adjacent Turkey's home center, Ankara) as well as the possibility of positioning your army in Rumania (instead of the fleet) which gives you better mid-game position should you need to attack Austria (with Italy) or defend against a backstabbing Austrian. In the near term, what should seal Turkey's fate is a fleet build in Sev. Even if you don't make fast progress, with Austria onside you might even be able to get into a good northern position early as well--you won't have to immediately guard against Austrian armies in Gal, Rum, or Ukr.

In normal games, I slightly prefer the Ukraine System to the Squid, trusting my diplomacy in the north can put me in a playable position in both theaters.  

And if diplomacy fails, tactical maneuvers can keep the Russian viable with even a single northern fleet.  

I cannot help but share an example wherein England and France have weakened Germany and where Russia holds a single northern fleet, desperately trying to stay relevant in Scandinavia.  

Imagine this scenario, where England proceeds to attempt to capture the Russian owned and occupied Sweden. Denmark is unoccupied.

Spring 1906  

England:  
F Nor - Swe  
F SKA S Nor - Swe  

The Russian F Swe is dislodged.

Russian retreat:  
BAL  

Why not retreat to Den? Retreating to BAL is more defensive, in one sense. It also still borders four supply centers: Swe, Den, Kie, Ber. Also, Den cannot be held, because England will still have 2 fleets adjacent and simply order: 

F SKA - Den  
F Swe S SKA - Den  

Fall 1906    

The English player decides his best approach is to self-standoff in Den. This way he will prevent either the German or Russian from claiming it, as well as retaining his just-captured Sweden.  

England:  
F Swe - Den  
F SKA - Den  

Russia, anticipating this, orders:  
F BAL S Swe - Den  

Ah ha! Russia's support is successful, helping the English fleet in Sweden out of his owned supply center, retaining control of it.  

In this game, the Russian may have had to disband that northern fleet if this gambit had not succeeded. 


## Southern System, Rumanian (Russia)

A Mos – Sev
A War – Ukr
F Sev – Rum
F StP(sc) – BOT

Looking for a fairly non-committal and defensive Russian approach? Look no further than the Southern System. If one so wishes, and the Austrian is inclined, the Bulgarian Gambit–attempting to dislodge the Turkish army in Bul–may be attempted in Fall 1901. However, the opening should not necessarily be seen as anti-Turkish. (See Strengths below.)

If Russia expects to be bounced by Germany’s F Den – Swe in Sweden, then she may elect to secure Rumania immediately in Spring 1901. In cases where you are nearly 100% confident of German F Den – Swe, you might opt for F GOB – BAL instead immediately in Fall 1901.

With F Sev – Rum, A Mos – Sev will succeed and establish the ability to support F Rum to hold in Fall 1901.

If Turkey is wary of the move South, remind him that with your army in Sev, he will not see a second southern fleet being built in Sev. Of course, in certain circumstances, you may opt for A Sev – Arm and put down a fleet in Sev.

While not a common opening, the Southern System is flexible and viable when Russia is uncertain of his southern neighbor’s openings and unsure of Germany’s intentions. With Turkey likely to be occupying the Black Sea, Russia will have to negotiate delicately. Richard Sharp does not recommend it, but I see value in certain situations already described.

## Northern System, The Squid (Russia)

A Mos – StP
A War – Ukr
F Sev – BLA
F StP(sc) – BOT

Similar to the Octopus (A War – Gal), The Squid puts immediate pressure on England to support himself into Norway. He will only gain the neutral with your good graces or by supporting himself in with fleets in NWG and NTH. If one is content to play an anti-English game from the start, putting the idea of F Lon – ENG in the English player’s mind–to defend against a possible French F Bre – ENG–is a useful ploy.

Sending two units north means you will have to be mindful of your approach in the south.

What are this opening's diplomatic advantages? 

Andrew Goff makes a great observation by way of a question: Who will be bothered by your northern opening?

Think about it. Maybe only England. But England was going to be in some conflict with you and may have walked into StP without some Russian northern presence in any case.

How about your other neighbors and Great Powers?

Germany will not be put off. France won’t mind. Italy too.

Austria will feel less immediate pressure, as will Turkey. Pressure can still be put upon Austria with the Octopus (A War – Gal).

This diplomatic advantage can be leveraged toward good relations in the south whilst Russia secures her northern flank. Then, assessing the position, Russia can decide where to build in 1901 and 1902 and be well-positioned to work with several or more neighbors.

Here’s a [well-put observation from Andrew](https://diplomacyopenings.wordpress.com/2015/11/30/in-his-house-at-rlyeh-dead-cthulhu-waits-dreaming/):

"Whether this opening is better or worse than the closely related Octopus is a matter of personal taste, but the family of openings involving A Mos – StP are simply too good not to have a deep understanding of. As a new player you could do far worse than making this your default opening as Russia – it has challenges and requires universal engagement, but there is no better way to learn the game and the strengths of the opening give you every chance to have a successful game."

-Andrew Goff, 3x World Diplomacy Champion

## Livonia System, Ukraine Variation (Russia)

A Mos – Lvn
A War – Ukr
F Sev – BLA
F StP(sc) – BOT

An outright attack on Germany with A War – Sil tends not to achieve much unless under certain scoring and game conditions where Germany needs to be put under immediate threat.

However, opening to Livonia does provide viable strategic options. It is an odd and unusual opening, which gives you the chance to explain it to your neighbors in various ways suiting your needs. It is not at all inflexible either. What’s more, as an objectively quieter opening, you will not be drawing too much unwanted attention to yourself.

In the first place, it allows for a convoy into Swe with A Lvn – Swe and F BOT C Lvn – Swe. When Germany has opened F Kie – Hol, the convoy cannot be stopped. When the German opens F Kie – Den, Russia should negotiate to allow the convoy to succeed (in exchange for a southern build). If Germany wavers, remind him to consider Russia’s alternate orders of A Lvn – Pru and F BOT – BAL. Further, if one wants to play such a game, Russia could even feign offense at the German’s unwillingness to allow F BOT – Swe and announce he will be ordering F BOT – BAL. Meanwhile, assuming Germany will take the bait, Russia continues to order his convoy and encourages England to order F NTH – Den (!).

Establishing the fact that one is capable of such a maneuver allows for more dynamic threats in future games. I say, Why not?

Additionally, A Lvn puts an army adjacent StP without committing it there in Spring 1901.

There are subtlities. As a small point: the way the pieces move makes A Mos – Ukr and A War – Liv seem less anti-German (if this opening can even be said to be anti-German) since the army in Warsaw seems to be moving away from Germany. Subtleties.

On Reddit, /u/wiithepiiple noted:

"That is a funny bit of psychology. A Mos-Ukr/A War-Liv is tactically identical to A War-Ukr/A Mos-Liv, but feels different. I guess because the move to Liv draws your attention, and the other is a “normal” move that doesn’t. Russia’s opening major question is “where do you commit Moscow, north or south?” Moscow goes south? Russia wants to secure Rumania and attack Austria/Turkey. Moscow goes North? Russia wants to attack England’s Norway and Scandinavia. Warsaw doesn’t draw as much attention, unless it goes west."

-u/wiithepiiple on r/diplomacy

For an approach that puts pressure on Austria, include A War – Gal instead of A War – Ukr.

## Ukraine System, Souther Variation (Russia)

A Mos – Ukr
A War – Gal
F Sev – BLA
F StP(sc) – BOT

Use the Ukraine System to remain flexible in the south and when you don’t need additional northern leverage.

The Ukraine System: Southern Variation beginning with A Mos – Ukr (and its variants) is flexible, setting Russia up for the neutral Sweden and Rumania. Frederico likes to suggest to Austria that A War – Gal is coming, and that A Gal – Rum (with A Ukr S Gal – Rum) is the plan for Fall 1901. By itself, the Austrian should not like to see a Russian army in Gal, but with the second part of your plan–removing that unit from Gal to reach Rum–the Austrian should be more comfortable with the Spring move. One way to make the success of the move more likely is to stir trouble between Austria and Italy prior to Spring 1901 moves.

What are the risks? With three southern units, Russia will have little early influence in the north. The move to Galicia may not be welcomed by the Austrian and delay any possible collaboration with the red units.

How about rewards? Unless you’ve diplomatically succeeded in avoiding a bounce in Gal, a careful Austrian will often bounce you there. This approach does give Russia more chances of securing Rumania, though depending on whether Russia stands to gain Sweden, forcing one’s way into Rumania is not always necessary to continue into a solid 1902, relationship in a good place with all neighbors. 


## TURKEY

While I prefer to play a more central and active Great Power, I do enjoy me some Turkey.  

#### 1901

With concentrated home centers in Con, Ank, and Smy, the Turkish homeland is relatively easy to defend for even sustained sieges. A four-center Turk with, say, a fleet in BLA, a fleet in AEG, and armies in Bul and Con is as formidable a rock as any four-center power.  

But you ought not merely aim to survive. Where is your fifth center coming from? This, conveniently, is a useful question for Italy. Will your fifth center be Greece, Rumania, Sevastopol? Which should it be? When is the best moment to annex it?   

#### BEYOND 1902

Turkey's game can be quite strong with only 5 or 6 centers. With fleets in AEG and BLA, Turkey can mobilize armies into southern Russia or the Balkans via convoy as well as defend comfortably. To win, Turkey will likely have to break through into Saint Petersburg or perhaps Portugal.  

#### ERIK’S CHOICE

The Ship of the Desert which showcases the surprising F Ank - Arm.


## Turkish Hedgehog (Turkey)

A Con – Bul
A Smy – Arm
F Ank – Con

A surprisingly viable and flexible opening for Turkey. 

Any variation of F Ank – Con in Spring 1901 can vibrate alarm bells across all of Europe, but the Turkish Hedgehog combines F Ank – Con with A Smy – Arm. The army in Armenia should be used as a diplomatic fact to dampen the signals of a Juggernaut (Russo-Turkish alliance).

Conveniently, such an opening could be used as the beginning move order to a Russian-Turkish alliance. Mr. Barbosa was not fond of the alliance, especially from the Turkish side.

With the Armenian army, the Turk puts Russia to a similar test as has already been discussed. “But look closer,” Mr. Barbosa urged me. Then I saw the following:

Fall 1901:
A Bul – Rum
A Arm – Sev
F Con – BLA

This continuation makes it very difficult indeed for the Russian to gain Rumania. More difficult than any other opening. (Unless of course, he is already there with Spring F Sev – Rum.)

Further, Turkey has the option to sail into the Aegean with F Con – AEG without contest. Whether you make plans with Italy, Austria, or Russia, your units are well placed to find leverage some kind of near-term alliance and quite possibly your fifth build in 1902 or 1903.

The Turkish Hedgehog will surely draw attention. How you use that attention is up to you. 

## Ship of the Desert (Turkey)

A mountaineer, storm-stained and brown
from farthest desert touched the town
And, striding through the town held, up
Above his head a jewell’d cup.
He put two fingers to his lip,
He whispere’d wild, he stood a-tip,
And lean’d the while with lifted hand,
And said, “a ship lies yonder dead,”
And said, “Doubloons lie sown in sand
along yon desert dead and brown,”

— Joaquin Miller 1875, The Ship in the Desert,
Roberts Brothers’ version.

A Con – Bul
A Smy – Con
F Ank – Arm ( ! )

Yes, your fleets can move along coastlines. And yes, you needn’t always play F Ank – BLA by default.

As with the Crimean Crusher opening, similar pressure is put on Russia to fulfill early game expectations of gaining Rum while maintaining Sev.

Openings like this play to Frederico’s flair and he was especially good at explaining his motives in numerous ways to his various opponents. With novelties comes the advantage of neighbors more open to nuanced explanations which serve your own interests more than theirs.

Tactically, F Arm provides the same threat to Sev with the bonus option of playing F Arm – BLA in Fall 1901 to either take BLA or cut support there depending on the Russian’s play. In most cases, Russia’s only guaranteed orders to take Rum will be to send the fleet. The best outcome could be to see Russia’s fleet land in Rum, a Russian army blocking a build in Sev (hedging against F Arm – Sev), and the success of F Arm – BLA.

From here, you can straightforwardly build F Smy and already be quite secure. Alternatively, you might build an additional army–to advance through Arm into Sev by Fall 1902–or F Ank to placate either of Austria or Italy.

## Crimean Crusher (Turkey)

A Con – Bul
A Smy – Arm
F Ank – BLA

The Crimean Crusher is another solid Turkish Diplomacy opening, giving diplomatic and strategic leverage against the Russian and with your neighbors Austria and Italy. 

With the Armenian army, immediate pressure is put on Sev. As a result, Russia is made to work harder to secure Rumania.

Imagine the confident negotiations you might have with each of your neighbors. Russia pleads for Rumania; Austria offers to help keep Russia out of Rumania; Italy asks for support into Greece. Having involved Italy in persuading the Russian to leave Sev open for a build of his own, you might swindle your way into Sev from Arm come Fall 1901. (The Russian opts for F Sev – Rum and A Ukr S Sev – Rum to secure Rum, and so gives up BLA to your F Ank – BLA.)

It is a dream start, 2 builds from Bul and Sev, all too common for a diplomat like yourself. Build a fleet and an army and carry on into a steady mid-game and eventually stab Austria for your solo.

The Crimean Crusher is a solid opening that should be added to your repertoire when in command of Turkish units.

## Balkan Concentration (Turkey)

A Con – Bul
A Smy – Con
F Ank – BLA

This opening picks up the neutral supply center Bul (just as all the preceding did), and A Smy – Con means Con will be able to support Bul in the fall (even if Russia and Austria aim a supported attack against it). You will have your build.

Meanwhile, you likely bounce with Russia in BLA or take it yourself if Russia plays the Southern Opening, with F Sev – Rum.

In this way, you keep relationships with each of your neighbors viable. From here, you might use Bul to support an Austrian attack on Rumania, either from Serbia or Budapest. This approach had multiple advantages.

The first, that it angled for a Turkish-Austrian alliance that you can exploit to your benefit later.

Secondly, such a maneuver often keeps Russia from gaining Rumania and limited him to 1 or 0 builds (depending on Germany’s action or inaction toward Sweden). Russia would certainly not appreciate the Turk’s providing of assistance to Austria, but he needn’t be completely averse to working with you going forward.  

Finally, in situations where Italy was keen to disrupt or even attack Austria in Fall 1901, you could tip off Italy to the forthcoming Austrian orders. Perhaps Italy could even take Trieste or deny the Austrian fleet in Albania from securing Greece. This series of events might demonstrate to the Russian that he might yet have a friend in Turkey, given that the Russian by end of Fall 1901 is likely in Galicia and prepared to leverage that position to Austria’s detriment.  

“Where are you going to build?” someone may ask you.

Where indeed? The most obvious place would seem to be Smyrna. The most obvious unit, a fleet, which will then set sail to the Aegean Sea, possibly to be bounced by an Austrian or Italian fleet. In some games, where Italy and Austria are aligned, this defensive posture is necessary to keep Con and Smy safe. If you remain steadfast, perhaps you could turn either of the Italian and Austrian against the other. Or, at some point, the French may sail east and give you the releasing of naval pressure you need to break out of the corner.  

Another straightforward option might be a build of Fleet Ankara. The situation may call for the taking of the Black Sea and a push into either Sev or Rum.
