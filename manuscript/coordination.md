# Coordination

Pick any global problem and assume you (as an individual) have near-infinite resources at your disposal. Can you solve the global problem you chose?  

No.

Why not? 

Because you will still have to solve the problem of *coordinating* activities with any other individuals, communities, organizations, companies, countries, institutions and international regimes. Even assuming each of these entities is on your side and in full alignment about the problem, getting your ideas from concept to implementation is difficult. 

Eliezer Yudkowsky of the Less Wrong community has written about this and Sam Harris has spoken with podcast guests on the same. There are others. 

You've probably experienced the same in your own working life. It is frustrating, and, even when and where there is agreement, uncertainty about whether a coordinated activity will be carried out in concert with the agreed plans with the desired quality and effect.

Diplomacy seems to simulate this ever-present real-world inevitability. 

### Few Guarantees

While watching Chris Martin's beautiful video coverage of the WDC 2016 in Chicago (available on YouTube), Chris remarks that one player, Peter Yeargin, seems to like guarantees. He also seems to understand that other players like the idea of a guaranteed (or near-guaranteed) outcome based on a certain tactical move-set. The problem? There are few guarantees in Diplomacy. 

In part due to unit density and in part thanks to the rule requiring attacking unit strength be greater than defending, coordinating supports and support-cutting with other players is often crucial to success in Diplomacy. 

Consider further that a unit in some situations may both cut support and hold its current position from a single unit moving into its occupied territory. 

The trick is ensuring that your neighbors, once a plan is made, actually follow through accurately on that plan. (Or, at least more often than not.)

Uncertainty exists in almost every conversation and in almost every decision on explicit move-sets. Many players are careful to divulge exactly which pieces are going where so as not to establish the expectation that they will be sharing the goings-on of each of their units every turn.


### Some Collaboration Required

In Diplomacy, coordinated approaches usually out-perform poorly organized efforts.

The fact that alliances rarely last the entire game nor even very long at all should not dissuade you from coordinating with neighbors. If you can coordinate, you gain the value of supports and support-cutting while also gaining value given that particular neighbor is not supporting your shared neighbor or support-cutting against you. 

Some games seem to tip on minor shifts in unit positioning, causing ripples and then waves that roll across the Med and Europe. Knowing this, keeping on good standing so as to enable collaboration is clearly necessary for much if not the entire game, with as many neighbors and players as possible. Exactly *how* you accomplish this is harder to showcase. However, what should be emphasized is this: If you encounter fellow players making a case that collaboration is impossible, they are likely incorrect in the realm of Diplomacy. 

Part of the beauty of Diplomacy is that it forces you to stretch beyond your zones of comfort in order to ally with people you may not particularly enjoy outside the game for your mutual benefit within it.
